you can not come to heaven because of you. so the more you strive to god because of you, the more you go away from god. because you are going a selfish way.
so it is no wonder, that the more the people trive to god, the worse they get, because their triving is all selfish.
look, jesus said, whatever you do to the lowest, you do to me. but that does not fit into your striving for greatness, as it is dictated in the entire world.

all your religions provide nothing but commands and chains of prohibitions
but its ok, bekause you are all in a ruling striving, so it is impossible for you to come to servant religions
you cant even imagine how something like that could look like
