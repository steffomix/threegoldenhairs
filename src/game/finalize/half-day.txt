### let's humble
# let them turn around
# look at all the people in front of you
# all to come into the greatest position of all times
# look at all the people in front of you
# all this people you pushed away, because of you, to come into the greatest position of all times
# look at all the people in front of you
# all this people you should care for but you only care for you, for you holyness, for your salvation
# all the people are are lying upon you like a grind stone
# you can not come close to god that way
# you can only come close to him by becoming like him
# and you become like him only by becoming nothing for your self
# and let everything that is not you become everything for you
# but you here so very close to me, you cared only for your self
# and there is no chance to deny it
# the whole world can see your selfishness dripping out of all of your pores
# you, who you pretend to strive for god
# so what you experience right now is a very mild version of a life review you will have after death
# when you get aware, that all you did was wrong


### let's turn around and make a life review
# {take servant staff} on the first day you got the shepherd staff from heaven
# but those who should take heed on it cut of it's tail, turned the body around in it's opposite and made them self god {replace servant staff with ruling staff}
# and the seals of heaven on it they turned into commandments
# and that way all the effort was wasted {throw away staff of rulers}
# but it is as it is, at least they created lots of obedient servants that way
# so let them go with it
# {take seals of heaven out of leather stash} on the second day a spirit from heaven came to you
# to remind you to become a caring servant for heaven
# but to become servant, for that was an offend
# so you killed the spirit of heaven {turn around seals of heaven}
# and that way all the effort was wasted {throw seals on rulers staff}
# but the spirit of heaven was released allready and had to be hidden to hide your crime
# {throw leather bag on seals} so you build a church on it to catch all who strived to heaven 
# and killed all who attempted to discover your crime
# {throw net-hammock on leather stash} but over time you got surrounded by a network of all who strived to discover the spirit of heaven
# so here we are today


### let's return to life for another chance on the third day
