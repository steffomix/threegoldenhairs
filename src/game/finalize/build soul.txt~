# what you just have seen you can not grasp without some purification
# into a heavenly striving
# because your body is most likely messed up in both directions
# and cause  plenty of distortions
# just as if your innier mirrors are dirty and suck up the light
# and when too much light hits all this distortions
# it feels like heavy heat, and can cause insane spirit pain
# and then - you run away or fall blank on your face
# therefore let us finish this simple device
# so that you can prepare yourself for what is coming upon you now
# because we are going into wisdom of divine majority now,
# build a soul from heaven and explain a little deeper how all that works 


### finish building simple device 

### let's create some angels
#  it works best outside in nature where you have a better spirit connection than in houses by default
# you have to look at it while doing it
# to get some connection to what you are blessing
# the same is when you bless people
# you need to create a connection to your target
# and this connection can be established even over a third being like a spirit guide
# or a person who knowed the person
# but in both cases the soul behind the body has to be known
# and to make it worse, the target soul can change through the blessing into different state of being
# especially through strong blessings
# so that you loose connection
# and have to reconnect
# so this water changes very quickly while blessing it
# so that you have to constantly reconnect
# to be able to bless it
# after a while or a view trys you may sense the water responding in some way
# like radiating or reflecting your spirit
# and indeed this water radiates its spirit in the same way like you as a person
# so basicly you have created a bottle full of angelique beings 
# or a spirit copy of your blood
# but even better
# it is pure and without all the distortions and all that crap that comes with your blood
# and of course you don't have to kill yourself or waste your blood
# so when the state of being of the water differs much with your state of being
# the effects can be pretty intense
## but you have to bless it with the spirit coming from your soul, from your inner heart
# so whatever you think with your brain 
# or whatever actions you do with your body have no effect
# and keep care that nobody looks at it or hear it, you don't want to influence it



### let's look at my shepherd staff you have seen at the very beginning to get a starting point
# there are 3 days and 7 seals
# so we draw a seven edged area
# and this area is the first day of your childhood
# and call it 7 mountains of love
# and the way how you place your goods or your love - that are your life experiences - into this area builds up your striving
# so you can be obedient against rulers, that are your parents in the first place
# to build mostly servant life experiences
# or you can rule or just be disobedient against others, that are your parents in the first place
# to build most likely ruling life experiences
# so basicly you can not build servants without rulers and rulers without servants
# because in your body you behave like free moving magnets
# where rulers attract servants and servants attract rulers
# where rulers repell rulers by punish them and judge them as demons
# and servants repell servants by comforting them with love and let them go their ways in forgiveness
# but in spirit we are like a part of one big magnet
# and barely come in contact with the other striving
# so when we now look into the book of life
# then we see that we need an intersection of the states of being
# to come together
# and thats how families are connected with their future childrens
# so you see, that when a huge community draws down more and more into the darkness
# the chance of heavenly souls reduces thhrough lack of intersections in the states of beings
# so that dark souls barely will bring light souls to birth
## however, when the parents are strong rulers, there is at least a chance
# that the children become servants through them
# so that the matter life on earth has some kind of self balancing abilities


### however, when you are a ruling soul, your overall development ends in the childhood
# your inner emtyness let you strive to the very outside
# where you find security through your strength and greatness
# so that your ruling nature becomes the way to protect yourself
# but that works only as long as you see a chance for success
# in the competition against others
# who do it the same way


### but when you belong to the servant striving, you will try to find security within yourself
# and begin to develop a most inner holy place where you feel secure amd confident
# and seal it with the most gentle, loving and all forgiving shields or seals you can ever create
# as a barrier to become unbreakable from within
# but to do so, you have to sacrifice some space of your outside beauty and greatness
# to have a place where your soul will live and defines it's meaning of life
# and this happens usually during your puberty


### so let's draw another 7 edged area into the allready defined area
# that is your second day of puberty
# or your sealed ring-like shield to your most holy place you have not discovered jet
## so during this time of puberty you finally move into your dressed up body 
# and have to deal with it, wheras a ruling soul 
# always stays asideof his body, like not really there
# so that there never a development of the soul takes place
# so when you - as part of the childrens environment - have managed to dress up a servant body for a ruling soul 
# you will be pretty surprised what a troublemaker you have all of the sudden
# but when you have managed to build up a ruling body for a servant soul
# you will have someone who most likely jump from the bridge to get rid of this unbearable thing


### so in the second day you basicly define your seals to protect your most inner holy place
# that defines the way you want to live
# and because - this can only happen to servant souls
# and we want to build a real strong soul soul
# we can call this area hallway of ark angels
# where ark stands for unbreakable
# and "hallway" because it is an area that protects your holy place 
# from everything that does not match the seals
# so this hallway works like a last frontier, that mediates to your most inner holy place


### but to discover the third day, that is our most holy place
# is not so easy
# because it is the place where we are connected directly with the source of life
# and it may sound strange
# but the source where we all come from is death
# so we have to face a terrifying environment
# and stay unbreakable servant in it
# to get literaly pressed backwards into the state of being 
# from where we all come from 
# a second time
# that is second death
# and this spirit death is a state of infinite despair and hopelessness
# wich is the state of being before all creation
# or where god will end up without you
# that's why god loves you so much
##
# and then you can't lookat anything anymore without seeing a reflection of yourself
# and the walls of your most inner holy place turns from glas into mirrors
# and every seal of your shield turns into broken doors
# and the love, that shines through the doors makes all impurities invisible and insignificant
# and your forgiveness breaks through all walls and mirrors as if there is nothing
# to bless every expression of your existence
# no matter what


### so let's draw all this
# there is the hallway of of ark-angels
# with the seals in the broken doors
# the light-beams of love
# the rivers of forgiveness
# that's where all the water comes from


### so when you now look at this construction
# it looks a bit like a blossom
# with the petals of your childhood 
# that expresses your life experiences
# and describes your ubique soul
# the anthers as your holy seals that describes our your striving based on your life experiences
# and the ovary as your most holy place in where you discovered your oneness with all everything
# so that only one
# who has a similar signature as you
# can enter it
# to create together the ovule, that is your most holy place
# where the tears from heaven
# filled with love and forgiveness
# fall from the sky
# to bless the purified waters coming from below
## well, you may not understand all that right now
# but wait, it's on the way


### so let's make an overview how it looks like right now
# there are 7 petals and 3 circles
# the outer heaven as the 7 mountains of love
# the inner heaven as the hallway of the ark angels
# and the most inner holy place with the source of life
# that are the never ending streams of forgiveness
# there are the 7 doors
# with the light beams of love through all 3 circles
# and in the broken doors to the most inner holy place we put the seals
# lying on the ground


### and the seals we make like that:
# one outer layer of thick and cleaned glass
# with the first day transparent engraved into it
# so that you can barely see, but feel it from the outside
# underneath the second day
# engraved in thick glass 
# and filled with white color of undiscovered wisdom of heaven
# and underneath of it a mirror out of thick glass
# with the third day engraved from behind through the reflecting layer of the mirror
# and instead of the seven mirrors on my shepherd staff
# the witness of the second day shall choose a name once and forever
# and around all the glass and mirrors put 4 mirrors with 12 holes 
# and put 12 lights behind them to shine into the seals
# and make a frame out of brass of hope of forgiveness 
# with 12  7-edged stars out of red glass of love around it
# where the light of the 12 lights shines through it to the outside
# and screw front and back together with 4 big screws on each edge
# gentle round from the upside as the four gentle winds of the 4 cardinal skydirections of heaven
# where peace and comfort pave your way to discover all faces of love and forgiveness
# but ruff and nasty from the bottom side as the 4 storms of the 4 cardinal skydirections of hell
# where performance and competition pave your way to discover all faces of hatred and judgement
# and make 7 screws on the top and bottom of medium size
# gentle round from the upside  as the 7 seals of heaven
# but ruff and nasty from the bottom side as the 7 courses of hell
# and make 10 little screws at the left and right
# gentle round from the upside as the 10 commandments of your childhood to be forgiven
# but ruff and nasty from the bottom side as the 10 commandments of childhood to be your judgement
# and put the seals in that direction on the ground
# that you have to go down on your knees 
# and look in a servant caring way from
# the inside of your most holy place to the outside
# to be able to read them
# and put them half into the doors and half in the hallway
# and on the backside engrave a ruff big cross
# to remind all those who are looking at it
# why they are not in heaven


### and the morning star make like a tear drop of love and forgiveness falling down from heaven
# for that make it like my shepherd staff, but cut of the first day
# and replace it with a solid line, made out of gold of forgiveness
# and instead of wood, make a conic hose out of silver of purity
# and hammer in the seven mirrors of awareness
# fill the conic hose with ashes of humility and hammer it in 
# and give the ashes a gentle moisture
# so that it does't fall of from alone
# then write the second and third day with leaf gold of forgiveness on it 
# like a gentle touch
# and polish it all to perfect brilliance
# then mold cleaned glass of Gods tears 
# and mix in some dust of diamonds of angels from heaven
# and pour it over the staff
# so that it looks like a long tear drop of the holy spirit from heaven
# and let it hang down from the center top of your most holy place
# with the line made out of gold of forgiveness from the first day
# to remind you
# that when you can't take it anymore
# and your forgiveness breaks
# a humble tear drop of pure love
# filled with gold of forgiveness
# is raining down from the sky
# to give you consolation and comfort
# and gently remind you to not throw away the holy spirit of heaven 


### now take water of hopeless and desperate souls
# from a deep well underneath your most holy place
# and let it run through your simple device several times 
# underneath the floor of the most holy place
# to clean it from all distress
# and let it run into a little shell like pond in the center of your most holy place
# from where it runs through the broken mirrors
#  through little holes in the corners of the mirror walls
# through your hallway of ark-angels
# into the gardens of heaven
# and call them seven rivers of forgiveness
# and all the water that you can not find a usage for
# let run to the outside 
# and let it sink back to where it comes from

-- needs handy for image --
### so lets draw a sketch of all this and add shields against magnetizing influences
# so there is the most holy place whith the morning star
# hanging down from the center top
# floating over the little mold, filled with purified water
# and the simple devices underneath to free the water from all distress
## the 7 mirror walls around
# broken 10 times from the bottom to the top to forgive the 10 commandments of your childhood
# which are needed only during the first day
# afterwards go like this:
# when your environment has become so poor, that someone needs to steal for whatever reason, who's fault is it?
## then we have the seven doors with the seals that are broken out of the walls from inside out
# and lying half in the doors and half in the hallways of the ark angels
# then we have the 7 mountains of love as the body of heaven 
# with everything that is good and healthy in several rings like year-rings of a tree
# and underneath of all that are running invisible the seven rivers of forgiveness
# with a little well in each ring of each mountain of love
# so that the more high the mountains of love are
# the more deep you have to dig to find the never ending rivers of forgiveness
# or where the mountains of love becomes low
# the waters of forgiveness comes to the surface
# so that you never ever come in touch with the ruling striving again
# and there are the 7 lightbeams of purifying love with the entrys to heaven at the end
# and an image from the outside with the two witnesses of love and forgiveness
# and the morning star in the center
# the blue sky to breathe vaporized love
# and the green grass of comfort at the bottom


### now shield the dome with a faradaic cage all around
# and shield the hallway of the ark angels  a  2. times with another faradaic cage all around
# and shield all  a 3. times with a faradaic cage all around
# and the whole building has no doors you can close
# not even the 7 most outside entrys have doors
# but keep the entrys and the doors between the days as small as possible to not destroy the shields


### so, this building is the representation of a soul from heaven
# and it describes how difficult it is to change your striving into it's opposide
# you literally have to destroy everything that does not belong to heaven
# so when I give a hellish soul water that is blessed with the spirit from heaven
# it has the potential to completely destroy him 
# or causes at least pain and illness
# because it destroys everything what this soul is living for from inside out
# all the good life experiences turns out to be bad
# and all your bad life experiences turns out to be good
# so you most likely can not drink it
# it tastes terrifying or something within you strives against it to drink it
# so changing your striving can mean to complete destroy your soul
# down to your bare naked sensation of existence
# that means death of yourself
# by going through second death
# of infinite despair and hopelessness
# and get reborn as a new soul and begin from start
# but don't understand this as a matter switch
# it is a spiritual switch
# and to be able to switch you have to understand to where you have to switch to
# so you have to understand how things work in heaven
# and how things work in hell
# to be able to switch into one of them

 
# so let's look how the command hirarchy works in heaven
# well, in heaven we do not command
# in heaven we provide opportunities
# but the responsibility of the given opportunity stays on the provider
# so that the one who become and grab an opportunity can grow in love
# and don't have to fear any consequences if he fails
# but if he fails, the provider can grow in forgiveness first
# and in love aftereards by executing the opportunity by himself
# so in heaven you should not provide opportunities, you can not handle by yourself
# or fix the damage that the one caused who has become the opportunity you provided
# so when you become and execute an opportunity from heaven
# but forward it to another one
# the responsibility stays on you
# therefore all in heaven is given by grace
# because he who gives it, see the potential in you to make it
# and when you make it, you can make it fully free, without any restrictions or limitations
# the only limitation you have is your potential
# and of course you can ask your provider for guidance
# but you can not expect guidance
# because expectations are nothing more than the result of predictions of your brain
# so whatever you expect that spirit should do, will never be served
# because in spirit we can walk only by trust, there is no prediction possible
# the only thing you can do is to pray by moving into desperation
# and let you hopelessness describe what you are praying for
## therefore no desperation and no hopelessness -- no help
# sounds hard, but desperation and hopelessness are just states of being like any other
# and once you learned to move into them, it isn't that hard anymore as it sounds in the first place
# and it is handled that way to make sure you really tried with all of your potential
# only that way you can grow in trust the most
# and only that way you can grow into a fully self aware and limitless being 
# and extend your potentials the most
# even if it sometimes means to face suffering or even go to the brink of death


### so I have 4 opportunities to give away
# the first is for the witness of love we have seen at the end of the second day
# to make you a morning star of any size you like
# but instead of glass you can use resin or some layers of paint color with a little glitter effect
# and you can use charcole instead of ashes, because it's easier to handle
# and you can use aluminium instead of silver and it doesn't even have to be conic
# and instead of gold leaf you can use a goldish looking pen
# then make sheath and a belt to wield your morning star like a sword
# but never punish stonehearted with it to make them repent in tears
# this sword is a guidance for you and for everyone who want to look at it
# but never force someone to do so or wield it too openly
#  to be end up as sharkfood or make mockers worse
# so make a sheath you can only partially look through
# you need this guidance, because you have the potential to watch over 7 mountains, the body of heaven
# but don't reach out on your own for someone to help you
# just sit and wait until someone comes to you
# if nobody comes, enjoy your free time
# and if someone want to build it without you, let them try 
# and when they struggle, don't help them
# let them go in forgiveness
# and let them fall into my hands 
# of infinite despair and hopelessness
# but for the case someone please you humble for guidance
# and you don't know how it should look in detail
# just let 7 mountains look like a christmas tree full of presents from heaven


### the second opportunity goes to the second witness of forgiveness
# we have seen at the end of the third day
# to make you another morning star just like the first witness of love
# and I want you to watch over the center dome, 7 rivers, 7 beams of light, the 7 entrys of heaven and the 7 seals, the wells in the mountains of love and the shields
# so basically everything that does not belong to 7 mountains of love
# but you will have to respect, how much room the first witness of love is willing to give you
# so if the second witness of love decides to make it all alone, enjoy your free time
# but if love gives you room
# let the first witness of love decide the name in the  3. layer of the 7 seals in the 2. day
# that will replace the 7 mirrors of the morning star because there is allready all mirror in the 3. layer of the seals
# and when love decides to overgrow your forgiveness as something useless
# let love try 
# and when love struggles, don't help until love is completely beaten down by hatred
# and is lying down in despair an hopelessness


### but for all
# even if the morning star is the most fearsome deamon-slayer imaginable
# it is not it's purpose
# it's a staff of guidance
# that become it's power by going in line with it
# but every time you use it to hunt down and cast out deamons
# you move into some hatred
# and move out of the alignment of the morning star
# and the morning star becomes literaly dull, dark and useless
# so don't punish stone-heated people with it 
# to force them into tears of repentence
# the morning star is not a staff of judgement that I wield
# I am the only one who has authority for judgement
# because I am the only one who can catch the consequences
# so depending on what striving you look at my staff
# you see a shephert staff of guidance
# or a sword of judgement
# that's why the spirit of heaven on my staff 
# is written with my very own fire of repentence


### let's figure out where to build all this 
# all matter reality is an expression of the meaning of spirit life
# but when you focus too much on the expressions of the meaning
# you easily bury the meaning underneath the expression
# and get lost in a meaningless life
# so you can indeed build all this anywhere 
# and even in multiple ways in the matter world
# but when you loose track of it's meaning
# you get buried underneath meaningless expressions of life
# your entire life becomes meaningless
# and you will begin to hate your meaningless life
# and will begin to repell everything meaningless in judgement
# until everything is destroyed within you
# and you die the second death 
# and fall into my hands of judgement
# to become an angel, a reflection of me
# and experience the difference between freedom and free will
## so the most favorite place where you should build all this is within yourself
# and only then, when it has become a solid ground within yourself
# and has been proofed to stand all storms
# so that this building and you has become unbreakable one
# then you can build it into the world as a memento of your conquest


### let's look deeper into love and forgivenes
# when you love, you give something away from you 
# or spend comfort for others
# but don't expect anything in return
## when you forgive, someone has something taken away from you
# or others have hurt you
# but you don't want to take or do something in return
## so love and forgiveness are the same
# the only difference is the opposide point of view
# or the opposide directions of action and reactions
## but look at this
# you forgive also
# when others gives you something from themself or spend you comfort
# but you don't feel the dept to give or do something in return
## so even if love and forgiveness are the same
# love is only a part of forgiveness
# therfore there are two heavens
# the lower heaven of love
# and the higher heaven of forgiveness
## in the lower heaven of love 
# you always have some sensation of dept or have problems to deal with unpleasant things
# so that there is comfort
# but not fully peace
# because without the full understanding of forgiveness
# you can't even receive anything without causing some sensation of dept
# so love is allready an expression of forgiveness
# and therefor the lower heaven
# where all the nice expressions of forgiveness standing around
# and when we look at our building
# we see the most high heaven in the center dome, the most holy place
# surrounded by a mediator
# a last frontier medium
# that is able to stand the full light beam of purity from the heaven of forgiveness
# and mediates between the both heavens
# because from the point of view of the most holy place
# I don't care about all the expressions in the lower heaven of love
# behind the mirrors
# because the only thing that I can see through the mirrors
# is what your heart is striving for


### 

--- need picture of four winds 
--- need picture of book of life with both tunnels
--- need spirit compass
### but let's look a bit deeper into the four winds of spirit realm
# here you see the servant striving of heaven
# and here the ruling striving of hell
# and when spirit winds move you out of forgiveness
# you can move into love, judgement or despair
# or when spirit winds move you out of hatred
# you can move into love, judgement or despair
# or when spirit winds move you out of judgement
# you can move into hatred, forgiveness or despair
# or when spirit winds move you out of love
# you can move into forgiveness, hatred or despair
# like this guy --- picture of book of life with both tunnels
# he moved from the lower heavens of love
# into the lower hell of hatred
# and back through forgiveness while he got beaten to death
# that's how he created this spirit tunnel
# and with it a spirit connection in both sides
# from the ruling striving of hell into the servant striving heaven 
# through matter life
# but because of some lack of forgiveness
# he didn't manage to hit the center
# and some fall through his judgement
# but there isn't anything bad on it
# because you can not make such deep tunnels in one strike
# without risking to get lost in darkness
## imagine you are looking for some friends
# who got lost in deep woods
# so you have to move into the woods as well to find them
# but all your effort is wasted
# when you don't find back and get lost also
# so it's better to explore the woods step by step
# and put a little sign for orientation on each step
## look, when you look at a wood on a mountain from distance
# it all looks easy - just follow the striving of up and down
# but when you are in the woods
# and don't even know any more why you are there
# things can become very complicated
## you have buried yourself into your expressions of life
# and lost connection to spirit realm
# and with loosing your connection to spirit realm
# your spirit compass as shown on the first day did become useless
# and you forgot the purpose of your life on earth
# so you did the obvious
# and began to build things that made your meaningless life at least easier
# and managed to build really fascinating devices that way
# that became so complicated
# to become a life simulation on it's own
# but because it's life-essence is based on fire
# what do you think
# to what will it lead you?


### let's go around the four winds
# love is a child of forgiveness
# and as long love finds it's servant home in forgiveness
# love is able to release from it's plays and adventures
# but when love has gone lost in it's adventures
# it can't find home anymore
# and love becomes desperate
# and love try to destroy everything that could be a hindrance to find home
# and move into hatred that way
## but when many come together in hatred
# things can become very complicated
# and the lost and desperate love trys to solve the problems with rules and judgement
# but judgement makes the sensation of being lost in isolation even worse
# and love gives up 
# and becomes calm in desperation and hopelessness
# and with it comes back
# peace of forgiveness


### let's look into the difference between man and woman
# the womans love is the expression of the mans forgiveness
# but when womans beauty of mans forgiveness has problems to let go from her love
# the man can move into judgement and draw his beauty into hatred with it
# and lead her into endless terror of competition and performance in consequence
# or he can remind his beauty of the meaning of love and forgiveness
# and lead her into endless joy of peace and comfort in consequence


--- needs book of life with tunnels
### let's look at the petals of the blossom
# they are the body of the soul
# and in a ruling striving 
# or at night in darkness
# they are closed and work like an armor
# but in a servant striving
# or at day in sunlight
# they are opened to express it's beauty of love
# but love can overdo to express it's beauty
# and the petals run dry in forgiveness
# the given love can not be forgiven anymore
# and the need to love back begin to rise up
# and with the need to love back
# begins the measurement of the given love
# and with the measurement comes up the need of something
# that expresses the result of the measurement
# and the expression of the measurement result you call money
# and with money the need for stockpiling money rises up
# and with stockpiling money, envy rises up
# and with envy, the need for protection rises up
# and blossom close it's petals
# and evetything becomes dark and ugly
# and love dies
# and with the dying love, hatred rises up
# and with hatred the need for rules rises up
# and with rules the need for judgement rises up
# and with hatred, rules and judgement
# the need for more petals for protection rises up
# and to protect yourself against others you took things like
# locks, armor, weapons
# but also makeup, drugs, habits
# and everything that distracts from yourself
# and your life became poor and meaningless
## so this guy told you to love
# to forgive
# and to not serve dead petals and cut them off
# but obviously the teaching of this guy was somewhat missleading
# and everything became even worse
# so I told you now everything you need to find back home
# but I will tell you also what will happen
# when you don't listen even now


### look at this little extended book of life
# here you see the servant striving spirit realm of heaven
# here around the matter reality
# and here the ruling striving spirit realm of hell
# and somewhere here outside this guy created a connection between both sides
# but when you don't want that
# and ripp of matter life
# you will have to go through my created tunnel in the very center
# from this darkest state of being of infinite despair and hopelessness
# into the highest heaven of forgiveness
# as shown in the building of the ark angels
# so it's on you what you want
## and you may say, but how can that be,the universe is so big
# there must be more life
# well, from matter point of view, life on earth is caused by the universe
# but from spirit point of view, the universe is caused by life on earth
# because everything is created through awareness


### let's look how to bring heaven back to earth
# you have to understand
# that heaven is a result of a striving
# so when your striving to love and forgive
# to create peace and comfort
# heaven dies
# so there is no being safed
# except you are being forced into a state of being
# so once again
# when you throw away this opportunity of life on earth
# all love and forgiveness falls back to me
# and you are forced into my heaven
# and yes, you will never ever face something bad again
# but that is not what I want
# I want that you become a heavenly being 
# because *you* want to
# and not because I force you to be an angel from heaven
## do you understand the difference between freedom and free will?
# yes, as an angel of me you have freedom
# but you have no free will
# as an angel you can not change
# except I change


### so to bring heaven back to earth you will have to strive for it
# every day
# every second of your life
# and even when everything has become like heaven
# don't stop to strive to make heaven even more beautyful




### let's look what you are like
# and HE asked 3 of his friends: "Compare me to something and tell me what I am like."
# and  the first one said, "You are like a righterous angel."
# and the second one said, "You are like a wise philosopher."
# and the last one said, "Teacher, words can not describe what I am looking at."
# and HE said to the last one, "I am not your teacher. 
# because you have drunk, 
# you have become intoxicated 
# from the bubbling spring that I have blessed."
# and contunued silently:

>>># whenever you want to know who and what you are like
>>># then just examine everything around you
>>># and whatever you can see *within* everything - is you

# and the others wanted to know what HE told him silently
# but the last one answered:
# when I tell you what he spoke to me, 
# you will percieve it as judgement
# due to your ruling striving
# and you will throw stones on me
# and they will return to you as fiery brimstones
## but when you are in a servant striving
# you will be encouraged
# to bless everything with the holy spirit of heaven
# you have discovered within yourself
## and when you enter heaven
# two heavens merge together
# and double it's beauty of diversity
# and in the same way you enjoy heaven
# heaven enjoys you


### let's look on the what causes what riddle and solve it
# from matter point of view
# life on earth is caused by the universe
# but from spirit point of view 
# the universe is caused by life on earth
## how can that be you ask?
# when you ignore all my warnings and continue
# to move into the dead expressions of life
# you will become one with them
# and you will discover the universe in fancy space-ships
# but when you look at this scenery 
# from a more distant point of view
# so that all scales down to a microbiologic level
## then ask yourself what you have archived
# by throwing all 3 days into the darkness...

### 

# who is the king of heaven of love
# where all the nice expressions of life standing around
# so the heaven of love is the lower heaven of comfort
# or the expression of the most high heaven of forgivenesss
# where is nothing any more but peace
## and on the opposide
# there is the lower hell of hatred
# where all the terrifying expressions of death standing around##
# that is an expression of the most deep hell of judgement
# so on the very outside between judgement and forgiveness
# is the source of life or death
# and even there is a king of the most high heaven of forgiveness
# that is me, "michael" the great prince
# but I am also the most high king of hell of judgement
# in the same way as the king of heaven of love is also the king of hell of hatred
# and you may wonder how that can be
# but when you look a bit deeper
# then you will have to admit
# that nobody ever caused so much hatred than this guy
# but this happens when you focus too much in love
# and forget to let go with forgiveness
# then you will end up like this love-guy in hatred
# and move more and more into the expressions of love
# and need an opportunity to move back through forgiveness
# or the other hand
# when you focus too much on forgiveness
# or you end up like me 
# and move more and more into judgement
# and need an opportunity as well to move back through forgiveness
# so you will have to keep love and forgiveness in balance even in heaven to stay there
# in the same way
# as you will have to keep hatred and judgement in balance even in hell to stay there


### let's look into the center




# and in the center
# where the striving is the strongest
# everything melts together
# into infinite despair and hopelessness
# that is the king of kings



### let's examine the difference between love and forgiveness
# when you love, you give something to another one or just spend some comfort and don't want anything in return
# so that no binding relationship is created and both can continue to move freely
# but forgiveness is more complex
# so you forgive, when someone has something taken away from you or just hurt you 
# and you don't want to do anything in return
# but you forgive also, when someone had something given to you or just comforted you
# and you don't want to do anything in return
# so without a deep understanding of both sides of forgiveness you can't even receive the pleasures of heaven
# but when you understood this, heaven appears to be very ignorant
# but that is all about peace, to not care
# so love can give you comfort by being active in caring, but only forgiveness can give you peace by releasing from everything
# therefore love and forgiveness are basicly the greatest enemys in heaven
# but even then, they can not exist without each other
# because without some contradicting forces there would never anything happen
# so there are even in heaven contradicting forces you will have to live with
# but when you move too far into one of this forces, you easily move into the other striving
# so when you focus to much into forgiveness and love begins to remind you to love
# you can move into love or into judgement by judging love to care too much
# and on the other hand, when you move too much into love and forgiveness reminds you to calm down
# you can calm down or move into hatred because of the ignorance of forgiveness
# so there is no place where you are fully save
# however, the amount of savety increases with the amount of your awareness and the awareness of your environment
# and because everyone in heaven is very aware what is going on,
# and understand the meaning of love and forgiveness
# it is pretty difficult to fall out of heaven


### let's look how the main spirit skydirections  relates to each other
# we start a forgiveness amd go around clockwise into love, hatred and forgiveness
# but let us start at forgiveness and go counter-clockwise by moving into the heavenly dream-state
# by moving into forgiveness, we move into the light of general awareness, without taking action
# so basicly, in our heavenly dream-state we dissolve like a drop of water in the ocean
# and because our awareness expands limitless, we will come across something we want to interact with
# so basicly, we come across something we judge, because we are not pleased with it
# and when this happens, we awake and move into loving actions
# and in hell it works very similar
# by moving into judgement, we move into darkness of general repelling everything to find peace
# so basicly, in our hellish dream-state we become like a dead stone
# and because we can not really isolate ourself from our environment, something will sooner or later interact with us
# and when this happens, we awake and move into hating actions


### let's look what this guy basicly did
# he moved from the heavenly dream-state into love
# but instead of releasing with forgiveness he move into the matter-area
# where the strivings clushes together
# there he send his message
# but to return to heaven he needed an opportunity to move counter-clockwise into forgiveness
# so choosed a very quick and rediciulus hard  way 
# by causing trouble against the ruling leaders
# to get most badly beaten up
# and never move into hatred or judgement while this happend
# but as said, it doesn't have to be that hard
# and just punishing you body is very ineffective and risky
# because you can die before you reach your target
# the other way is through psychic terror and forgive everything no matter what
# that was my way
# but even this way is not without risk
# because you can kill yourself before reaching your target


### so let's look into the coming spiritual warefare and what is to come
# basicly this is up to you
# or in other words
# in the same way what blessed water causes in a human body
# human body causes on earth
# for this I have prepared a spirit world thing to explain this
# look, here we have the servant heaven side
# and here the ruling hell side
# imagine this more like a ball for a better understanding
# and the border is the lower striving area
# so basicly the matter reality
# and in the near future, with the next major development of matter life
# the connection between the strivings completely breaks
# imagine to cut this in two with a knife or scissors
# but because both strivings can not exist without each other
# another connection or a spirit tunnel from the most high mountain of heaven
# down to the most deep pit of hell has been established allready
# so once the old connection through matter breaks
# and you can't move to heaven any more by becoming a heavenly being through matter life
# you will have to reach this dark spot of infinite despair and hopelessness to move to heaven
# but to reach it, everything that does not belong to heaven has to be destroyed within you
# every hope to get proud and sucessful has to be completely destroyed
# otherwise you can not switch into the servant heavens
# so the door to heaven through learning love and forgiveness has been shut down
# and you have to go through the other door
# by becoming a complete desperate and hopeless failure within your ruling environment
# and then
# one of my angels will come and pick you up to become a member of heaven
# all will be forgiven
# you will be covered in everlasting love
# but even if your freedom will be limitless
# your own free will will be reduced to what was left within you that belonged to heaven
# you can get destroyed down to a drop of water and below
# so your blood is in my hands then
# but that is not what I want
# I want fully free beings around me
# who can stand my spirit presence as if it is nothing special


### is there a chance to keep the eath and free the earth from all evil?
# yes, there is
# but the risk, that all this mess repeats -- stays
# and you have to understand, that you can not reach this with hatred and judgement
# instead there will be needed plenty of endurance and forgiveness and yet some love
# so when you want to give it a try
# I can perhaps help you on that
# but you have to understand that I have to follow the rules of heaven
# and can't just do something you probably don't want
# so I have to ask you to for permission provide some help and protection
# to lit up your little campfire in your house again


### so when you think this is something needfull
# there is a forbidden place I like to go - sometimes
# a last bedtime story in my mind
# and some deeper knowledge if you like
# perhaps you want to hear it with some nice cool drinks, dressed up with some angels
# but you have to understand, that I can not accept to get prised, applauded
# I can not serve expectations, because they only outputs of your brain-TV
# and I can not accept too much comfort
# just that much that I can survive it and stay halfaway healthy, that would be nice
# otherwise I have to shut down and you get nothing from me
# and when I get aware you move into pride, hatred or judgement becausevof me
# I have to shut down also
# so you have to be at least humble or you get nothing from me
