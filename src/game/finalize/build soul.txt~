# ok, seems to work
# 
### so let's build an expression of a soul from heaven
# to understand why it is so difficult to cross over the strivings
# so there are 3 days and 7 seals as describrd on my shepherd staff
# so we draw a seven edged area
# that is the first day of childhood
# and call it 7 mountains of love
# and the way how you place your goods into this area
# builds up your striving
# so you can be obedient against rulers, thats most likely your parents
# and become the goods like a revard
# or you can rule against others, thats most likely your parents
# and enforce the goods you think you deserve
# so basicly you can not build servants without rulers and rulers without servants
# because in our bodys we behave like free moving magnets against each other
# whereas in spirit we are like a part of one big magnet
# so the weaker our striving is, the more likely we move into the matter reality
# but the stronger the isolation through the matter body is, the more likely beings with even stronger strivings will move in
# and when you look at the book of life, you see that all souls who are born on earth come from somewhere
# and have allready build up a more or less striving


### so, that's about the childhood
# and within the childhood we draw another 7 edged area
# that is the second day of puberty
# because during this time of puberty we get literaly nailed into our dressed up body and have to deal with it
# so when you have managed to dress up a servant body for a ruling soul 
# you will be pretty surprised what a troublemaker you have all of a sudden
# bit when you have managed to build up a ruling body for a servant soul
# you will have someone who most likely jump from the bridge to get rid of this unbearable thing


### however, when you are a ruling soul, your development stops here
# because you strive to the very outside to rule over it
# and punish everything that dares to touch you
# to become unbreakable from the outside
# but when you belong to the servant striving, you will rule over yourself
# and develop an most inner holy place
# and seal it with the most gentle, loving and all forgiving seals you can ever create
# to become unbreakable from within
# and that way the second day turns into a hallway of the ark angels
# where ark stands for unbreakable
# and this hallway works like a last frontier medium to your most inner holy place


### so when you now look at this construction
# it looks a bit like a blossom
# with the petals of your childhood that describes your life experiences
# the anthers as your holy seals that describes your striving based on your life experiences
# and the ovary as your most holy place in where you discover your oneness with all everything
# so that only one who has the same signature as you can enter it
# to create together the ovule, that is the morning star of heaven
# and the reason why there is all mirrors is because you see in everything nothing but another expression of yourself
# and you love and forgive everything as if it is you


### so let's make an overview how it looks like right now
# there are 7 petals and 3 circles
# the outer heaven as the 7 mountains of love
# the inner heaven as the hallway of the ark angels
# and the most inner holy place as the throne room
# now we make 7 doors and hallways through all 3 circles
# like a beams of light
# and in the doors to the most inner holy place we plave the seals
# lying on the ground


### and the seals we make like that:
# one outer layer of thick and cleaned glass
# with the first day transparent engraved from the outside
# so that you can feel it
# underneath the second day engraved in thick glass 
# and filled with white color
# and underneath of it a mirror out of thick glass
# with the third day engraved from behind through the reflecting layer
# and instead of the seven mirror, the witness of the second day of love shall set a name
# and around this seal add 12 lights
# and the orientation is that way, that you have to put yourself into pount of view of caring
# so looking from inside out to be able to read it


### and the morning star make like a tear drop of love and forgiveness falling down from heaven
# for that make it like my shepherd staff, but cut of the first day
# and instead of wood, make a hose out of silver of purity
# hammer in the seven mirrors of awareness
# fill it with ashes of humility and hammer it in so that it don't fall of from alone
# then add the second and third day out of leaf gold of forgiveness like a gentle touch
# and turn it all upside down and polish it to perfect brilliance
# so that the second day is at the top and the third at the bottom
# then mold some transparent and colorfree glass of Gods tears and mix in some dust of diamonds of angels from heaven
# and pour it over the staff 
# so that it looks like a tear drop, filled with the holy spirit of heaven and ashes of humilty as its core falling down to earth
# and let it hang down from the center top of the center dome with a thin line out of gold of forgiveness
#  so when you can't take it anymore and your forgiveness breaks a teardrop from heaven falls into your heart
# to give you consolation and comfort and remind you to not throw away the holy spirit of heaven 


### now take water from a deep well underneath the center dome
# and let it run through the simple device several times underneath the floor of the center dome
# and lit it run into a little shell like pond in the center
# from where it runs through the broken mirrors, through a little hole in the corners of the walls
# through the gardens of heaven
# and call them seven rivers of forgiveness
# and all the water that is not used, let run outside and let it sink back into the earth


### so lets draw a sketch of all this and add a shields against magnetic influences
# there is the center dome with the mold and the simple device underneath
# the morning star hanging down
# and break the walls up to the roof 10 times to forgive the 10 commandments
# they are needed only during childhood of the first day
# afterwards go like this:
# when the environment has become so bad, that someone needs to steal for whatever reason, who is the thief?


### now shield the dome with a faradaic cage all around
# and sketch the hallway of the ark angels with the 7 seals all around
# and shield it a  2. times with another faradaic cage
# and sketch the 7 mountains of love with the 7 rivers of forgiveness
# and shield it a 3. times with a faradaic cage
# and from the most inner center sketch 7 hallways as light beams of purity through the small sealed doors
# and where ever this beams of light shines, place nothing
# so that the more humbling small the doors to the center dome are, the more can grow the 7 mountains of love and express its beauty
# and at the end of the end of the hallway of purity project an image from the outside that look like this (show handy)
# the two witnesses of love and forgiveness with the son of men in the middle


### so, this building is the representation of a soul from heaven
# and it describes how difficult it is to change your striving into its opposide
# you literally have to destroy everything that defines you as who you are
# so when I give a hellish soul water that is blessed with the spirit from heaven
# it causes unbearable pain
# because it destroys everything what you are living for
# all your good life experiences become  bad
# and all your bad life experiences become good
# so you most likely can not drink it
# or it tastes terrifying
# so changing your striving means the complete destruction of your soul
# down to your bare naked sensation of existence
# the death of yourself by going through second death of infinite despair and hopelessness
# and get reborn as a new soul
# but to be able to switch the strivings like walking from one room into another like me
# means to die thousands of times until you get used to it
# and the state of being of second death becomes a normal state like any other for you
# and love turns into desperate love, forgiveness turns into desperate forgiveness at one side
# and hatred turns into desperate hatred and judgement turns into desperate judgement
# so your entire point of view becomes desperate and hopeless
# and you discover the truth, that you can not see God and live


# so let's look how the command hirarchy works in heaven
# well, in heaven we do not command
# in heaven we provide opportunities
# but the responsibility of the given opportunity stays on the provider
# so that the one who become and grab an opportunity can grow in love
# and don't have to fear any consequences if he fails
# but if he fails, the provider can grow in forgiveness an love by trying to it
# so when you become and execute an opportunity from heaven but forward it to another one
# the responsibility stays on you
# therefore all in heaven is given by grace
# because he who gives it, see the potential in you to make it
# and when you make it, you can make it fully free, without any restrictions or limitations
# the only limitation is your potential
# this is because in heaven we walk by trust


### so I have 2 opportunities to give away
# the first is for the witness of love we have seen at the end of the second day
# to make you a morning star
# but instead of glass use resin, it's less heavy and does not break so easy
# and use charcole instead of ashes, because it provides better purification abilities
# and you can use aluminium instead of silver
# then make sheath and a belt to wield your morning star like a sword
# but never punish stonehearted with it to make them repent in tears
# this sword is a guidance for you and for everyone who want to look at it
# but never force someone to look at it
# so make a sheath you can only partially look through
# you need this guidance, because I want you to build seven mountains at least one times
# wherever you want
# but don't reach out on your own for someone to help you
# just sit and wait until someone comes to you
# if nobody comes, enjoy your free time
# but if someone want's to give you a hand, and you don't know how it should look in detail
# just let 7 mountains look like a christmas tree full of presents from heaven


### the second opportunity goes to the second witness of forgiveness
# we have seen at the third day
# to make you another morning star just like the first witness of love
# and I want you to build the center dome, 7 rivers, 7 beams of light, the 7 entrys of heaven and the 7 seals
# and my message to combine it with your knowledge make it complete
# but you will have to respect, how much room the first witness of love is willing to give you
# so if the love decides to make it all alone, enjoy your free time
# but if love gives you room, make a big image on the end of each of the 7 entrys like this
# and let love decide the name in the 3. day of the seals, that will replace the 7 mirrors of the morning star
# because there is allready all mirror
# and in each mountain of love make a little well, but the rivers let run invisible
# and when love decides to build 7 mountains like the year rings of a tree
# make a little well in each ring of each mountain


### so there are some who have been touched allready by the spirit of heaven
# directly through spirit realm
# that may have been the king of heaven or even me
# and you will know this without a doubt
# and if this happened, you will be able to bless water with the spirit of heaven for sure
# but you should bless youself with it for a couple of days to become a stronger and more stable connection
# so that you can help others
# but you should help children first
# because you will get in direct spirit contact with those you help and everything evil that goes along them
# to give them strength and help them fight their fight against all evil in them
# and children are the most easiest to handle
# evil natures in children may be very violent but have most likely low endurance
# however, be carefull and don't overtax yourself
