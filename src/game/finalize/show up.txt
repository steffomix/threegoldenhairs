### The first of two witnesses, forgiveness, Melinda Key Lyons - Most high angel of the third day of majority, belongs to he who is like god, that is Me.

### The second of two wirtnesses, love, Shelley L. Sherrill - Most high angel of the second day of puberty, belongs to that adolescent brat Jesus Christ.

### That kiddo Moses, who doesn't understood anything belongs to the first day of childhood.

### All churches, religions and those who go along with them belong to poop, garbage and lukewarm piss. Thank you for your service of being a carrier, you are not longer needed.

You want to know to where you belong to? Check out that simple device for self testing: 
Melinda wanted to know how we create Angels? Just hold two mirrors against each other and put a light in between, then you know how. But when your mirror is full of poop and garbage and distorted through greed, you will create nothing but waste and darkness.

You may find that the last word on my shepherd staff is written wrong. No it's not. Your life you have anyway, so it's all about how you want to live.

### One seal on the first day of Moses - Childhood
### Five seals on the second day of Yeshua - Puberty
### One seal on the third day of the Lord - Majority


### Whoever looks at this staff of life and find himself in all seven seals like looking in a mirror will live in heaven

### but when there is only one seal broken, you will not see heaven


### however, as a last chance you can write your broken seals into your soul with a fiery pen of repentence and hopelessness and cry at least one tear of endless despair and Yeshua may have mercy on you.

### But when you can not bring up fire of repentence for the sake of heaven, you have not understood what worth heaven is. Then I the Lord may come to you, move you out of your death, to let you experience heaven, only to throw you back into your own sevage, to die a second time and with the fiery memory of heaven burning into you. Then you have plenty of fire into you to repent.

### I had to surpass second death and bring me back to life for heaven completely alone, to be able to rescue everyone, no matter how deep he has fallen, so that there is no place anymore where you can get lost. But dare you to mock that worthless and I turn my shepherd staff into a fiery sword and let you suffer and wait for me in your distress as long as I want.

How to test:
While the vortex is etablished in your simple device as shown in the video, contemplate your understanding of heaven as vivid as possible into it and look at the water.


Test failed for heaven:
Fear and depressions vanish and insane hatred and wickedness grow up into you out of nowhere, so strong you can not beat down. You may even receive a vast amout of life energy and feel like a walking battery.

Test has no effect:
You are lukewarm sevage. Those who failed the Test will care for you. They always have a need for weak slaves.

Test success for heaven:
Fear and depressions vanish and insane bliss and peace grow up into you, so strong that you can not sin against it. You may even receive a vast amout of life energy and feel like a walking battery. You are a saint from heaven and can make blessed water for the fallen, so make water for the children first. 
For the older who have surpassed puberty be warned that sharing your blessed water will create a direct touch with them and you will have to share and fight their fights to help them out of their distress. So it's on you who you give your water. Nobody from heaven will judge you for withholding your blessings for your savety.
But never make water for the lukewarm or they will stick on your feet like nasty stinky poop and drain all life energy out of you.
