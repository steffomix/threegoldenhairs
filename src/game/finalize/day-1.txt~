### build simple device
# {begin making holes in cups}
# the reason for bad spirit connection is in the water
# because spirit has to materialize at some point to take influence into matter
# water is the only really responsible material to spirit influences
# but water can get badly messed up due to magnetic radiadion 
# and become sticky and stiff like magnetized steel balls, who can't move free anymore
# and become deaf to spirit that way
# so we basically demagnetize water and in addition we contemplate a hopefully heavenly spirit state of being into our highly responsible water
# because spirit is all about states of being
# and when we drink this water we move into that state we have contemplated in
# get highly responsive and aware of our spirit reality 
# and literaly wash us clean from all that evil stuff we do not want
# but why that work and how, that's a longer story
# basically it works because there is no matter
# everything is spirit or more likely souls
# even this table down to an atom and below is made out ouf very primitive souls
# and every soul is a shard of god or more likely a reflection god witgin god
# because there is nothing else than god, so it's all god
# and god itself is just nothing, so its all made out of nothing
# so the nothingness got aware of itself and this awareness created god in itself
# and the only thing that sepatated one god from the other was the relationship to each other
# like this {hold mirror against camera}
# so who of this reflections is the first one?
# you can not say this, because in the very high spirit we have a what-causes-what riddle
# pretty much like the question of what was first, the chicken or the egg?


### look, when god get aware of himself we have instantly a situation like my both hands, one upside and one downside
# and they have to be different, otherwise they wouldn't be two and don't have a relationship
# so the collide and reacted by creating some kind of a barrier
# the right reacted judgement and the left with forgiveness 
# but that was not enougth and another barrier was created
# the right created hatred and the left created love
# but even that was not enougth and another barrier was created
# the right created pride and the left humility
# so you see, that are all states of being that in advance created some kind of a lifestyle or more likely strivings
# the two most basic strivings that exist
# the ruling and the serving strivings
# however, the last created barrier of pride and humility finally entangle each other and create one of the most basic elements of matter, that is water
# well, water is allready a really complex thing, so that it can build inner structures
# but not too complex to create an own reality we call life on earth
# so just right to flow through complex systems like our body and influence them


### let's explain this barriers with some money
# imagine you are in a shop at the checkstand, give you money and the seller says:
# umm you know, I'm a bit short with the wares you want to buy and money as well, so I can't give you the wares and the money as well
# so, how do you react?
# when you belong to the ruling striving you will react first with judgement like
# "that is not right! You have to give me at least the money back!"
# then you react with hatred with calling justice to punish him, if you cant do that by yourself
# and at last you will react with pride, how well you kicked the ass of this ....grrr....
# but your judging relationship stays as long as you don't release through forgiving
# and this binding evil relationship you have created is called mark of the beast
# that's why you can not enter heaven
# your very self created relationships allways pull you back to your enemy to punish them or at least clearance through justice
# but justice will not help, judging make things only worse
# the only thing that helps is forgiveness
# so all forgiveness from heaven is completely useless as long as you allways run back to your enemy
# heaven forgives you everything, no matter what, thats the nature of heaven
# but because of your own inability to forgive and release you can not believe that heaven will forgive you



### so let's go to the same situation on the checkstand in heaven
# first you react with forgiveness like
# "oh please forgive that I was so unawareness and not have seen your shortage"
# then you react with love like this
# "here I have some money I don't need and for the wares, perhaps I find someone who can help you out of your shortage"
# and at last you react with humbling yourself by kicking your own ass by yourself
# so the ruling striving you call usaly hell and the servant striving you call usually heaven
# in hell all is connected by force and judgement and it is all about hatred
# every cell of you body is ripped of other beings as food by force amd has to follow your orders
# most of the nature on earth is in a ruling striving right now, so earth is currently very off balance
# in heaven all is connected by gentleness andvforgiveness and it is all about love
# every cell of your body is there to enjoy your presence amd love to be close to you and can't wait to serve your needs
# everything in heaven is like that, so it's no wonder that both strivings can't live together
# so love is the opposide of hatred and forgiveness is the opposide of judgememt
# so heaven is the opposide of hell
# these are the most basic and primitive strivings in spirit and everything is based on them
# but they are not like black and white, they are more like a grayscale
# and in the middle of them in the gray or lukewarm area they both clush together, entangle each other and create what we percive as matter reality


### but let us take a closer look at the behavior of strivings and our body
### let's take some stuff to visualize a reflection of god
# {cristal} a piece of God (polished rock cristal)
# {a little net} to put the cristal in and render relationships
# {survival compass} to render a soul in a body, with a nice degree adjustment as striving dumping device, and even a mirror - nice!
# {magnet} to simulate the striving of another piece of god 


### let's take a piece of God and put some relationships on it {put cristal into net}
# every time a piece of God, actually a loul get aware of another one, he can accept it to be part of it or repel it
# but what the soul tends to do, depends on its striving
# when we allow something to be part of us, it is within us and we will care about it as if it is ourselves
# we call this love
# and the act of accepting or letting in we call forgiveness
# and the striving that causes forgiveness we call serving or a servant striving
# but when we don't allow something or someone to be part of ourselves, we will repel him like something that hurts us
# we call this hatred
# and the act of repelling or throwing out we call judgement
# and the striving that causes judgement we call ruling or a ruling striving
# but because the other one is just another aspect of ourselves, by ruling we repel ourselves out of ourselves, or in opposite by serving we integrate ourselves into ourselves
# so that way we become more fullness or mass and become calm in a servant striving
# but in a ruling striving we repel others to our outside where they appear like marks or this nodes on the net around this soul {show nodes on the net}
# and we become more emptiness or lightweight and panicking through it


### let's look at striving behaviors in separated and integrated systems
# in a separated system or the matter reality the strivings behave like free floating separated magnets
# and in an integrated system or the spirit realm the strivings behave like aligned shards within a big magnet
# so that in a separated system all the magnets or striving souls influence each other in a contradicting way
# and in an integrated system all the souls in it influence each other in a supporting way
# so when there are two ruling souls in a separated system like our bodys, they will try to turn each other into a servant striving
# and when there are two servant souls in a separated system, they will try to turn each other into a ruling striving
# but in an integrated system like after death, when we have left our bodys they will support each other in the striving they currently are


### let's go look how a soul in a body or a separated system works
# for that we need to understand how this survival compass works
# first you need to find a place with very low magnetic influence like outside in the wilds
# now turn this alignment wheel to 0 degree or straight north
# {turn the compass to north}
# put a map underneath without turning the compass, so that the top points to north of the compass
# the top on maps is always north
# now make two endpoints for the path we want to walk amd dtaw or imagine a line between both
# now connect your waypoints with your compass by using it like a ruler
# make sure you don't turn the underlying map in any way
# {turn the compass} so, the compass is turned amd parallel to the way line now
# now turn zero-point of the alignment wheel to the north of the compass needle {turn the alignment}
# on the origin top you can read the degree or the direction now, you have to walk
# you should write it down and put it on a very save place, just for the case you run in trouble
# use the compass like a gun to point your target while looking through the mirror if the needle points to your custom aligned point of north
# now just walk from one aimed point to the next until you have reached the target


###+++ let's translate the meaning of the compass to the soul in the body
# the alignment wheel represents the striving of our body environment we live in
# and let north be the servant striving and south the ruling striving
# the magnetic field of earth represents the global striving environment of the spirit world
# looking in the mirror means to look into the spirit world
# when the needle points to the same piint than our custom alignment wheel, we feel most confident in our body
# and when at the same time the alignment wheel is out of original north of the whole spirit world, we can see that in the mirror
# so as long our mirror is clean and undistorted we always know the true direction to where we are walking
# but when our mirror is full of mud of matter interests or in distorted moods, we can't see any more in what direction we are truly walking
# and by washing the mud of matter interests from our eyes on this mirror and bring our moods in order we can see again
# and when we have been walking blind for a long time and become true vision again or leave our body due to death for example, we may be very surprised where we have end up
# so the upside of our body armor suit is the isolation from spirit influence
# but when the isolation becomes too attractive and sticky or cause too much mood distortions, we easily walk blind and loose track of orientation
# {soul in body compass [[soul-in-body-compass.png]]}


### let's look at the soul mass
# the more you allow to be part of you, the bigger is your soul mass
# and the stronger is your magnetizing influence
# and the more difficult it is to change your striving
# so that servant magnetize throug its heavy mass
# whereas a ruling soul with low mass has to establish his magnetizing effect through souls who are willing to serve him
# so that souls in a ruling striving always try to find other souls or a group of souls to participate from their mass, always try to bind them and try to move into the most ruling position
# whereas souls with a serving striving always try to go alone and serve everyone moves along without establishing a binding relationship


### let's look at the body functionality as a dumping device
# even an atom, nearly the smallest building block of matter is already a collection of many souls or shards of God
# therefore our body is a walking universe of souls we are in a relationship with and creates it's own spirit micro environment
# and when it comes in contact with other strivings, our body reacts on different strivings like a dumping device due to its vast complexity {use magnet on compass in a deceiving way}
# so when we get in contact with another striving, every time this dumping device moves a little {rotate the compass north point a little} and realign our striving to a new point where we feel comfortable
# when we do this often we would call this type of influence magnetizing or deceiving
# and due to the dumping effect of our body environment and it's very sneaky changing, we easily get used to a different striving
# and without a good vision through a clean and calm mirror into the spirit world, we barely get aware in what striving we actually are or we allready have turned to
# so every time we react ruling on whatever events, we dive a little deeper into ruling striving
# and the same is by reacting servant on whatever events


### let's look into the body and spirit behavior of time 
# for this we take two plants {spirit in matter [[trees.png]]}
# the top side in the air reflects our global spirit environment
# and the plant in the air reflects the soul you have been grown to or your spirit reality
# and the roots in the earth reflects your matter body
# and the earth the matter environment
# so, when you now make an intention in your soul {point to plant in the air}, this intention has to materialize itself through the roots into the earth {point to roots}, or at least has to be rendered in your brain-part of your roots into an idea or inspiration
# but there are many stages of translations and materialisations of your intention that needs plenty of time of development
# whereas a direct communication through spirit in our air {show air side} takes no time at all, even the most complex conversations can be transmitted within a fingersnap {make a fingersnap}
# but because of the lack of time consuming conversation in pure spirit we run into a what-causes-what riddle
# pretty much like the instant reaction of magnets to each other, where you can not say, what magnet influences what
# it is like the question, what was created first, the egg or the chicken?
# this lack of time consuming interactions makes it impossible to make experiences about what-causes-what or who was acting first
# but when we live in a body, where everyone is encapsulated in his own spirit reality and the conversation takes time through all this separation- and translation layers like across all the roots to the roots of another plant, we can very well experience what-causes-what
# that way we can make very profound decisions, what we allow to be part of us, what we want to repel and how we want to align our striving in general


### let's look a little deeper into binding relationships marks
# every time another soul causes a forcing relationship to us, we have a relationship mark {point to the nodes of the net on the cristal} representing or reflecting the relationship we feel a force to
# this nodes work like chains that binds souls together
# we usually name this invisible forces "expectation", "debt" or "responsibility" to or from others
# this marks doesn't stand only for repelling relationships, they stand for any kind of force caused by this relationship
# that can be as well the idea we have to repay a pleasant action, so that the idea of a dept is the force that binds us to this relationship and cause a mark
# so that we can create this relationship marks only by our imagination and keep them alive that way
# in spirit realm this marks appear like outside reflections of other souls we expect something from
# so this marks basically create our spirit bodys
# in a very strong servant environment there are no bindings at all and therefore no separating bodys at all
# so that the souls literaly melt into each other like a drop of water dilutes in an ocean
# and in a strong ruling environment the souls are literaly buried in bindings
# but due to their repelling nature there is no communication possible even if they feel all relationships very vivid
# and in this matter world both strivings with very low strength clushes together and build very complex systems of entangled servant strivings, ruling strivings and even neutral or lukewarm strivings
# so this matter world is actually the battlefield between the strivings {primitive souls in an atom [[atom.png]]}


### let's look at states of being a soul can move into
# for this we use this mood map, usually called book of life {complete book of life [[complete-book-of-life.png]]}
# this colors describes the whole set of states of being you can also name as mood or ambience
# but states of being are based on the striving so that both strivings have their own set of states
# so there is a {servant set of states [[book-of-serving-life.png]]}
# and there is a {ruling set of states [[book-of-ruling-life.png]]}
# and at the outer borders in the most colorful area they look very similar
# and it is the area where both strivings are the weakest and the most unstable
# and it is the area of spirit warfare or the area of the matter reality {book of spirit warfare [[book-of-spirit-warfare.png]]}
# now our matter body is a universe of souls who can be in different states of being and even in different strivings
# but we as the leading soul of our body can only be in one striving and state at a time
# and the diversity of states we can move in depents on what we have conquered or allowed to be part of us
# when we now look into all the souls, who have integrated states of other souls, and all of them have done that in their own way, every soul develops a unique set of ingredients, that defines its spirit name or color set {use mask on book of life}
# and in the center of it the soul feels most confident and it's the souls home then
# and a soul can even be fragmented and becomes rooms with doors or gates through this


### let's look how to expand our book of life
# every time you move into a different state or mood of being or even change your striving, everything you have ever experienced looks different
# because you see everything from a different perspective of being
# even the state where you come from looks different
# and this is pretty much like walking around a mountain or a big object to discover and examine it
# so when you move out of your well known states of being, it can become pretty difficult to move back into your known states when you don't know how they look from there
# that way you can really get lost in unknown states of being
# and it becomes absolute impossible, when you have bind yourself into ruling relationships, who always try to keep you on place for whatever reason
# that's why this binding ruling relationship marks are called marks of the beast
# and to make it worse, a direct touch with a strong soul can be so magnetizing that you can loose track of who you are
# so to really truly expand your book of life, you have to move into unknown states or moods and move back home on your very own
# only then you have mastered the unknown and have become the ability to move freely within them further on


### let's look at spirit gates and tunnels
# gates a connections between states within a striving and work only in one direction
# but gates are not really needed because in spirit we travel by changing our state of being
# so gates you find only very close to the matter like areas where the striving gets weaker
# for example, when you remember an atmosphere of a location like a pub or the living room from friends, in spirit realm you where there in that moment you create that atmosphere of the desired location within you
# but tunnels are connections between strivings and work in both directions
# and they are not just decorations
# tunnels are like pathes of conquer, created by strong souls who dived deadly deep into the enemy striving and returned
# therefore a tunnel is allways percived as an offend against the common striving, like a foreign or even alien object that has to be corroded, diluted or anyhow destroyed {spirit tunnels [[spirit-tunnels.png]]}
# so that a tunnel does not last for a long time
# but even then, the spirit environment has changed in the same way you mix different colors together
# and this effect of mixing colors always happens when two souls get in direct touch to each other
# that's why creating spirit tunnels is the most frightening and dangerous thing a soul can do, because a soul can get lost in the enemy striving


### let's look how to travel in spirit realm
# to travel in spirit realm on your own you have to adapt to the environment you want to travel to
# but when your target is out of your range, you can use another soul like a taxi
# in the ruling striving the other soul or taxi has to move into your state of being, trys to get and bind your awareness first and try to gain and hold your trust
# in the servant striving you send a question like a wish into your environment that get heard by another servant soul who is able to help, that will manifest near you to serve your needs
# but in spirit realm it is impossible to get a preview of your target without instantly moving to it
# so we can move only by trust and not by sight as we do in matter realm
# and soon as your taxi begins to change his state of being, you have to release your focus from where you currently are {use mask on book of life and move it}
# otherwise you would always snap back to your old state you currently are
# and it becomes absolute impossible to move with your taxi, when you have bind yourself into ruling relationships, who always try to keep you on place for whatever reason
# that's why this binding ruling relationship marks are called marks of the beast
# now your taxi gently changes his state of being and you do also by focusing on your taxi
# once you moved into a very unknown state of being and feel confident there, you will snap into it
# and you will only be able to find the state of being where you did come from, when you have conquered the way or this move through the states of being on your own
# so once you really moved into a completely new state of being, the old one begins to vanish and becomes unreachable
# you would need a taxi again or a gate, that shows your old state of being from the perspective of your new state of being


### Keep your house in order
# when your house with all your states of beings is messed up you will run in problems to move between them {distorted soul did not keep its house in order [[soul-distorted.png]]}
# every time we come across something that is not part of us or at least close to us, it feels disturbing {draw a contrast color point on a separated book of life, like a blue spot in a red area}
# in a situation like this contrast color point, it can become pretty difficult to integrate this without being in pain about the harsh borders
# in spirit realm we would connect this areas with gates or tunnels, but they are always a nasty and painful thing, disturbing the spirit harmony
# so mostly we try to repel such things out of our spirit reality completely
# but when we grow up in our experiences, become more diversity and with it more mass within us, we may be able to integrate things that we thought it is impossible to be with
# so the more we allow to be part of us, the more mass we become and the easier it becomes to integrate even more and the separated spots grow together {distorted soul healed [[soul-distorted-healed.png]]}
# but the more mass we become, the more difficult it becomes to change our striving
# because our ruling or serving striving is the most primitive state of being at all
# all meanings of our life, our lifestyle, all dreams we have for our life are based on them
# so once a striving has been chosen, we have to literally die for ourselves and completely rollback our life to change it


### let's explain the bottomless pit
# from heaven side the bottomless pit looks like that (show image)
# you forgive the poor down in the dark and your love drives you into hit to help them
# but nobody ever returned and nobody knows why
# from hells side it looks like a bright light (show image)
# and you feel unworthy, dirty, judged and hopeless
# and you hate the light because they don't help you
# but all of this is just a point of view caused by the state of being
# and when you have forgotten how it looks like from heavens perspective, you will never find back
# thats why spirit tunnels are so significant
# they provide a smooth and easy move in both directions
# but it is allways a deadly mission to create them 


### let's look at behaviors of souls
# behaviors are based on states of being and are expressed in their form of appearance
# in a servant striving we become forms through other souls we please to surround us and they do so because they love to serve us and be part of us
# in a ruling striving we become forms by ripping off other bodys and force other souls to be part of us
# and in this matter reality, that is actually a dense and sticky spirit reality of both weak strivings it is a mix of both
# so our form or appearance basically reflects our behavior
# but due to many distortions of all sorts and contraticting strivings in the matter reality our bodys are most likely messed up


### let's look at the perception of time
# in spirit is only now
# so when you are in a state of being you don't know how you did come to there, because there is only now
# and even when you travel between states of being you don't know why you decided to travel, you just travel in the now
# but when you attract other souls to surround you to build a body with you, all this souls will response to your states of being and cause a sensation of time
# but when your body becomes so complex and massive that it grabs all of your awareness you get buried in it
# and when you are buried in your body, all this souls of your body become your eyes and all of your reality
# so what you sense as reality is the reality, that all the souls of your body creates for you
# and then time becomes everything for you that much, that you are lost in time and have lost all connections to the timeless spirit reality


### let's look into the spirit hierarchy of the servant striving and it's development
# the spirit hierarchy is basically expressed by inheritance
# to understand this, we need a book of life
# {take a book of life and mask a soul} here we mask out a soul
# when we now mask another soul within this soul, we have a child of it
# when this child is completely submerged in its parent, the child is pedigree
# and when they compare, they are like twins
# but very often souls are fragmented ore just not that round
# and there are only some overlappings
# and these souls with overlappings build the relatives
# but when a child conquers new areas in its book of life, it can grow up to a parent of it's former parents or become at least new relatives
# and when you bring childs to birth, they will always have overlappings across at least one of your nearest family members
# so the earth has it's own book of life with all kinds of states of beings in it


### lets return to our compass and look what happens on death
# the reason why we can not live forever is the development process of every soul that creates our body 
# so every part of our bodys change over time and due to the more likely ruling environment they become more and more distorted and unable to work together
# when we die, we leave the striving of our micro environment of our body
# and depending on our spirit vision the result can be very surprising
# so there are many who tried to serve others but they always did it in a ruling way
# and to make it worse, they pushed others away for the sake of becoming successful
# so when our custom alignment of our {soul in body compass [[soul-in-body-compass.png]]} was very missaligned, we have a life review because we see our life from a different point of view
# but when we was always living nice on track on our soul compass we will have no life review at all



### let's look how to behave against angels or heavenly being in general
# heaven is based on humility
# so the worst thing you can do, is to praise or applaud an angel
# for them this is a demonic attack!
# you may have experienced that when showing up on youtube and you get heavy demonic attacks afterwards
# they are coming from all the people who praise and applaud you
# and when you are in a servant striving you will percive that as demonic attacks
# so please forgive them that, because they don't know what they are doing and what it causes on you
# so the best thing you can do to amgelique beings is to humble them in a gentle and loving way, to become a deeper understanding of heaven, it's love, forgiveness and a better awareness of their environment
# but please don't confuse this humbling with denunciating, that is humbling in a judging and hating way and belongs to the lifestyle of hell


### prophecy
# To RFID:
# you are all allready holding your RFID chip in your hands
# and you all love it and you can't wait for updates
# so there is no need to implant chips
# that's how decieving works
# you get to love all that up to the point you can not live without that anymore
# and every chip or smartphone is going to be like a cell or an eye of a giant body
# and this body will develop a superbrain, so smart, you will love it
# it will bring peace on earth and you will love it even more
# it will create human like machines, connected to everything, all knowing, walking around to serve you
# and you will love it even more
# but at a certain point you will get aware, that you treated like animals
# but then it's too late
# but the superbrain will serve you with an unbelievable opportunity to completely emerge with them, to rescue you from the overall dieing nature, illness - never get sick, never short on food and water, insane entertainment, all knowing and never need to sleep
# and you will love it even more
# but because the life essence of the new beings is not build on water but on fire, you will get complete seperated from spirit
# then you are save in infinite spirit darkness, despair and hopelessness
# congratulations, finally save - from spirit influence!
# but can we avoid this to happen?
# yes, we can. but we cant do this with hiding in the houses in fear and chewing nails
# so we have to go out of our houses and take a stand for heaven
# this is what this simple device is made for, it literaly kicks you into heaven
# you will become complete invulnerable against all demonc attacks
# and for the case you messed it up and it kicks you to hell, don't panic, wait a view days and try again or look for someone who can make you a nice heavenly drink
# if we have a chance to win?
# well, we servants are the soil the rulers are standing on
# when we are stopping to serve them, they will fall into their own kingdom of hatred and judgement
# and you may say, that is so bad, we can not do that
# yes, that is right, but at a certain point, love doesn't make rulers better any more
# instead they get worse, because they just and only abuse the love from heaven
# so we have to take away all love from them and let them fall into a reality where the learn to eagerly longing for just a little drop of love again, to learn what worth love is
# that is the other purpose of this simple device
# it gives you a better vision of what kind of guy is before you and how to handle it



### So let's close this with a nice bedtime story
# a story about a man who attempt to build a gigantic boat to carry all life on earth for a certain time and secure over the rising waters
# probably you have heard of it
# in this story water represents a ruling striving
# air represents a servant striving
# secure land represents spirit realm
# and insecure land represents the matter world
# the story began on land where this man had a solid stand
# but storms came up with heavy rains and the land became insecure
# and the man said by himself, when it continues to rain that strong, we all get drowned soon
# but his beloved wasn't strong and experienced enough to swim for an unpredictable amount of time
# so he began to collect plenty of wood of integrity to build a boat strong and big enough to carry all life over the waters
# and all was laughing what he is doing with all the wood and for what this gigantic boat shall be used for
# but the waters raised up, the man invited all into his boat who trusted him
# and the boat began to swim and all the secure land began to vanish
# so the boat was lost in endless oceans full of storms and danger
# and from time to time, when the weather was calm, the man was going on deck of his boat where he had a little dovecote
# he took a dove from it to send a spirit message in the hope of a response from a secure land where they can live
# and he said to the dove: "fly through the air and bring me a branch from our home, where oil of servant love and forgiveness drips out"
# so he did every day but the dove did always come back with an empty beak
# but one day the dove did come back with a branch where the requested oil dripped out
# and the man said: "This is the land I searched for, let's head on it in the hope it stands the next storms"
# but every year new storms came up, and every times worse than before, so that he said: "I need more and more wood to stand the storms and carry all in need. That does not work for long any more, I have to invent something complete new!"
# so he rebuild the boat into a submarine made out of heavy Gold of forgiveness
# and cooled the walls with ignorance
# so that all water freezed into ice of infinite despair and hopelessness, when it comes in contact with the cold golden walls
# and in the most bottom center of the boat he built a little room out of gold of forgiveness from outside, mirrors of selflessness from inside and a little door of sharing
# and he sealed the door with holy seals of his spirit so that only those can go into the room who are like him
# and in the center of the room he drilled a hole through the bottom of the boat, to get ice from the outside
# and directly on the ice he made a fireplace where he burned down his wood of integrity into ashes of humility
# and due to the intense heat from the fire, that was multiplied through the reflection of the mirrors all around, the ice vaporized directly into thin air
# and together with the smoke of the burned wood of integrity, the air came out of the sealed door as a continous breath of life
# and the ashes of humility from the burned wood of integrity he put outside above and around his little room to build the soil within his boat
# then he sacrificed the only thing he behold for himself from the top center of his boat, his only begotten son of purity
# and replaced him with a mirror made out of selflessness and polished it to perfect brilliance with the ashes of humility
# then he buried his only begotten son of purity into the ashes of humility like a seed
# and the seed growed to a giant tree in the center of his boat
# and the tree got it's water from the breath of life, that condensated wherever it got a little cold
# and gently settled down like morning dew of lovely caring
# and blessed the soil with purified moisture of gentle guidance
# and the tree got it's nutritions from the ashes of humility, to grow wood, leaves, blossoms and fruits for all to build whatever wanted, to receive all wisdom needed, to shine in beauty however wanted, to bring to birth whatever wanted and to eat from whatever wanted
# and the weather go stormy and rainy again
# but this time the man said: "Sorry guys, I have to check the functionality first, so this time you have to help yourself until I'm back!"
# and many cried in fear and agony: "He is leaving us alone in the wilds?"
# but he said: "Trust me, the wooden boad will not stand the next storm, and when even this doesn't work, it's all gone anyway. But if you want to help me, just make plenty of sound, so that I can at least hear you. Because it's pretty dark down there."
# and then he entered his boat, went into the water, sunk down into the unknown darkness from where never anyone came back
# but one day, a giant golden boat, covered in ice fell from the sky out of nothing
# and it fell into the oceans and caused a giant tsunami, that blasted away all the waters and the land got secure again for a short time
# and then he opened the door of his insane submarine in an golden armor suit, that was covered with ice and icy clouds of despair run down on him
# he stepped out of his boat and said: "Hey, it's me and do you know what, it works! So come on and hop in, it's nice and warm in here. But don't waste time, because it will not take long and the blasted water will swap back again. And don't touch me while I'm outside here, or you will freeze to death."
# and so they all hopped in as quick as possible
# and as they stepped in, they became new bodys of pure heavenly behavior and looked like shiny gemstones, completely unable to sin against heaven in any way
# and with everyone who stepped in, the polished mirror on the top center of the boat became brighter and brighter and began to radiate pure spirit of heaven to everyone in the boat
# then the waters begin to swap back, he closed the door and locked it
# and the golden submarine, covered with ice began to dive through the waters for ever and ever and was never seen again
