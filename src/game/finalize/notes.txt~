# burn down your wood of integrity in the fire of repentence into ashes of humility
# then let run purified water of life through your ashes of humilty from the bottom up to the surface 
# the ashes of humility will turn all stinking poisen of pride in the water into fragrant medicine
# and the alcalines of peace in the ashes of humility will neutralize the acid of competition in the water
# so that only the purified water with minerals of life experiences will come into the heavens 
# to be the building material for all sorts of comfort 
# and to explore all faces of love and forgiveness




### let's make a note to not be confused
# I tell you all this retrospectively 
# and I try to tell you all that as comfortable as possible
# but at the time all that happened I had no clue what is going on
# and it was all but comfortable
# you have no idea what it means to stumble into the darkness with with the knowledge of heaven in your heart
# so when someone say it's better you never have been born, it's not like that, it's even worse than that
# modern psychics say you can not cry longer than 30 minutes in a row
# but that is not true
# being brapped in pitch black darkness knowing the heaven you have messed up, you can cry forever and continously
# and the pain consumes your complete soul and all of your heart and it never stops
# and it is not the body pain you have, it's your whole soul that screems continously in unbearable pain of the lost, of what you have messed up
# but it is the only way to reach the state of all who are lost there also
# but never found out a way to recover from it


### let's look at the two whitnesses, the greatest enemys of heaven, you will be surprised
# {take third image of ezekiel}
# the first enemy is love which connects us
# but when love becomes too intense we overheat and begin to melt and stick together
# and we get exausted and begin to hate love
# but hatred makes us sticking even more together
# and the second enemy is forgiveness which release us from each other
# but when forgiveness becomes too intense we become cold and begin to separate from each other
# and we get bored and begin to judge the eternal life
# but the worst we can do is to become lukewarm where we don't even feel the need to understand anything and come back to life again
# so the best we can do is to become an understanding how things work
# and become the ability to love and forgive limitless
# so when it becomes too hot, then armor yourself with gold of forgiveness and cool the armor down with ice of ignorance
# and when it becomes too cold, then throw away your armor and get in direct touch with your environment
# that way the greatest enemys of heaven become your best friends
# and we can release all breaks
# and move into limitless beauty and joy


### let's examine the meaning of obedience
# when you are in whatever state of being and there is a call for whatever need
# and you have problems to release from your current state of being to serve the need
# you are not obedient
# so being obedient basically means to be swift and do not stick to whatever state of being
# so when you enter heaven and those in heaven sense that you stick to it's overhelming beauty
# they will throw you out because you have not understood how heaven works and why it is so beautiful
# heaven means to be firm and swift in all your states of being you can reach
# and that means that you can enjoy states of beings from others without getting cought up from them and stick to them
# once you understood this and are experienced in it
# all limits of freedom and joy can be released


### For about 2000 years ago the matter world was a bottomless pit from where no soul ever returned
# until one day, one soul managed to ceep holy his servant striving during his whole life and returnen to heaven
# and with his return the book of life expanded {show image of book of life}
# and he created a spirit tunnel from this deep dark place back into heaven
# but he did even more, to expand the book of life as much as possible, he tried to get in contact with as much ruling souls as possible to expand the book of life even more
# and due to the unvorgiveable nature of the ruling striving 
# and the wicked attempt of the servant soul to show up that redicilous way in the ruling kingdom of the matter world
# the knowledge of him was very magnetizing
# he got unforgotten and became a special addon on the simple device
# and this simple device had an unitizing effect
# it removed spirit distortions and provided a better way for the lost souls to return to heaven
# so to enhance it's effect you can add some magnets to it anyhow
# it does not have to be so nice like this, just some magnets or shards of them close to the quick rotating bottom of the vortex is enougth


### Let's look a bit at this wierd looking simple device 
# with a little understanding that all is made out of souls, it should be clear that this simple device works even for your current matter body and of course all nature
# with it you can easily create a portion of unitized water with the striving of your choice
# {show two bottle types} whereas this slim works better than this bold
# with this device you create basicaly a unitized striving live and integrate it into your micro environment of your body just by drinking it
# it unitize and harmonize your distorted striving in your body, so that it can get so strong, that it becomes impossible to act against it
# it takes a couple of days of use, until you feel the released life energy that come into flow again, that can be pretty intense 
# but due to the overall distorted, mostly ruling striving of the earthly environment your striving get quickly distorted again
# and distorted strived water develops invisible inner borders very similar to borders of countries caused by the imagination of their goverments
# so that the overall material transport suffers interruptions and cause several problems
# but I'm sure you will figure out by yourself what it all does, so don't waste time with that
