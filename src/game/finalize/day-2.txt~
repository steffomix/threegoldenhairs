### let's prepare for climbing the mountain
# from distance everything looks so easy
# but when we are on the mountain and directly in the woods, on the bottom of the mountain
# our spirit sight turned is pretty much lost
# and we have to deal with our brain, that is like standing in the woods
# and when we are on the flat bottom we can't even strive servant up or ruling down
# so let us be at least obedient like little kids and trust that all is good as it is even when it is very unpleasant
# that way we move into forgiveness, disconnect from any attractions and become a better overview of our environment
# so forgiveness is the very first thing we have to learn
# and to forgive means to not react, to not even think to react whatever happens
# so love connect and attract
# and forgiveness disconnect and let go
# that way we have four directions in the servant striving that are serving up, ruling down, love left and forgive right
# and we have four directions in the ruling striving that are ruling up, serving down, judgement left and hatred right
# so your life becomes successful up depending on the general striving of your environment and what kind of compass you use for your orientation
# {serving environment [[angel-yeshua.png]]} for a loving environment the servant way just imagine it is early in the morning, the sun is croaching like a thief underneath the horizon and the morning clouds are gently settling down to bless the weak at first and the useless the most whereas the great and strong have deep roots to gather their blessings by themself, so that everything can grow up in peace and comfort safely
-# {ruling environment [[angel-satana.png]]}  for a loving environment the ruling way just you summon dark clouds for heavy rain to break the weak and drown the useless, you summon fiery praying storms of judgement and heavy winds of hatred to blow all away that dares to be greater than you, so that everything get destroyed in performance and competition safely
 


### Let's create a separated environment
# spirit has to materialize at a certain point to express itself as something really existing
# but for that we need a fluid substance with as less inner bounds and distortions as possible to prevent errors during the materialisation process
# {take a bottle of water} air means servant striving, water means ruling striving
# due to its contradicting nature and the lack of integrity between both a stormy relationship begins
# water vaporates into the air, and air get cought down into the water
# the air becomes clouds and it begin to rain and the water becomes like boiling 
# so that there develops a great storm and the heavens begin to drown in water
# in their despair the heaven build up a strong being, who was able to keep holy the air against the water 
# and became like a boat through this to pick up all servant life and settled down the storms that way
# but every time the storms came back they got stronger
# and the heavens had to find a new way, to get water from a place where it is ready to turn into air and become a member of heaven
# take two cups and tape them together to explain this {tape together two cups}
# now make a bottomless pit into it {make a hole in the two cups and connect two bottles with it}
# when this water drips through the hole it creates another isolation layer
# like a more complex body that shields the spirit from the global spirit environment
# but when we look into the next stage we see that it is just a repeat or a reflection of the situation we allready had before
# the only difference is the distance to it's source
# and to become an idea how often this already have been done, just look at the very early stages {show image of an atom}
# and every time we turn around the bottles for another chance it get only worse
# but one completely insane guy managed to move all the way down while keeping holy his servant striving and returned back to heaven
# that way he created a spirit tunnel {create a vortex in the bottel}
# but through the tunnel all the knowledge from heaven came into this deep isolation also
# and increased the development of even more isolated bodys rapidly
# this new bodys will not be based on water any more because the isolation is going to break
# the new bodys will be based on fire
# so we have to create a complete new tunnel into a state of being that have all separation layers in common
# that way we create a tunnel that works on all stages no matter how deep it will ever get


### let's clean the separated environment from distortions
# we in a body are literaly living walking universes of beings
# and our relationship to it is basicaly a ruling one
# and we are isolated in our body through an unbelievable amount of matter layers
# and the only gap we have left to reconnect with spirit is water
# so water is the only element that reacts on spirit because it is made out of the most early separation layers
# but for that the water has to be pure and undistorted
# otherwise the spirit influence behaves like looking through a violent water surface
# and everything we percive is completely messed up
# to make it worse, distorted water does not move free anymore, become hard and sticky and cause several diseases {show the marbel machine demagnetizer video}
# so in ancient times the protection through the magnetic field was enougth
# and dirtortions came basically from the food we eat
# but in our modern times with all the electronics and radiations we are bypassing the natural protection shield from earth
# so that the main distortions come from the water itself today, especialy in citys and fasting becomes nearly useless that way
# to compensate this and enforce the natural magnetic field, we add some magnets around the vortex, where it rotates the fastest
# so just add them anyhow to the simple device {show simple device with peacemaker}
# magnets you find everywhere today, like in bicycle dynamos, hard drives, magnetic pins for notes or even in door seals from old fridges for example
# use this now about ten times and drink as much as possible at once to literaly flood your body with purified water
# but when you create purified water, you should contemplate a servant striving or state of being into it
# you do it just by looking at it while being in a very intense state of being you want to have in the water
# so don't be lukewarm and learn to move into powerful states of being on will even when there is strong influence from whatever source
# and when you are very sensitive allready you should sense a response like a reflection of your state of being coming from the water
# and the first effects after a view days will be a very enhanced life energy 
# and a very enhanced vision into the global spirit realm of your striving or state of being you contemplated into the water
# and it can become that strong that you become completely unable to sin against what you have contemplated into it
# but due to it's strong effects to your brain you may become intense headache or feeling like under electricity power first times
# and due to the better flow of purified water old muskle tensions can release, that can be very painful first


### let's look how our separated environment works
# our brain works by predictions and expectations
# and walking by predictions and expectations means to walk by sight
# but in spirit we walk by trust because we can not foresee states of being without instantly moving into them
# and walking by trust means to walk without predictions or expectations
# so to connect our brain with spirit means to remove everything that does not belong to spirit
# and that means to turn off all expectations and predictions or simply all thoughts, because predicting and expecting is the only thing our brain can do
# so we basically move our brain into a spirit state of being that is basically like being dead
# but we don't have to do that for long because spirit is timeless and transport informations within a fingersnip
# but we have to do it as serious as possible
# and we have to do it while being fully awake with open eyes to make sure that the spirit is delivered directly into our awake consciousness
# otherwise it would not only take ages to get the spirit into our awake consciousness, it would get polluted with everything coming across the way
# and you get only an already rendered result you know from heaving dreams
# so we just have to try to thing nothing for several seconds or minutes at maximum with all willpower we can bring up
# and spirit will deliver an amount of white spirit flour that our brain can handle to process without getting insane
# so we will become only very small portions first until we have developed some experiences to handle bigger portions


### let's learn to shutdown the brain for just a moment
# for that we have to be awake with eyes open and look at the same time at something meaningless as possible that our brain want's to process with thoughts
# something like a bright spot on a dark background or something we hold in our hand, so that all behind blurs, because it is more far away
# and we can even use just our finger tip
# now we try to think nothing, don't even have any emotion
# we only have our self created spirit environment that can be a little emotional
# and we try to think nothing with all willpower we can bring together for at least 30 seconds, but not longer than 10 minutes
# it will feel like a big ship driving sometimes through heavy storms and sometimes through calmy sea
# and we can do that in stages as if you are lifting heavy weights, like in regular muscle training
# or like a woman who has labor contractions
# so as said, the willpower you bring up is all that counts
# and you need to bring up that willpower from your soul
# so don't try to think to think nothing, that does not work
# when you are successful, you should become a little dizzy
# and you may even feel, that your spirit environment change a little
# and after a while you will have hard times to stay awake, because the need for sleep becomes overhelming
# and when you have problems with addictions or attractions of any kind, they will become very intense because you try to rip them off like an old sticky tape from the skin
# so addictions can become overhelming temporarily
# if so, just try to withstand as long as you can, before moving into hatred or judgement against your self
# and when you can't withstand any more or fall asleep, it's ok, nobody cleans a complete messed up house in just one strike
# and when you fell asleep and awake, you can be breathless or like under shock, because you was near dead for a little moment
# but you mostly will not instantly remember what you have experienced, because you brain needs time to render or translate your spirit experience into a matter story or images
# because in spirit we are only meaning and have to express or dress the meaning into a colorful form of behavior
# but in matter it's the opposite, the meaning is literally buried under countless expression layers
# so the only way to come back to spirit is to break through all this layers


### let's dissolve into the spirit realm
# {use mirror on mirror} for this we put two mirrors against each other
# and make sure that the room between the mirrors is free of any expectations or predictions
# and at one of them we remove a little from it's reflection layer
# but this little impurity we look through causes darkness because it does not reflect but suck up awareness instead
# so we can not get aware of anything without causing some impurity
# but we can make our self as small as possible by being humble
# and the mirrors have to be true parallel to your self
# so when you serve in a humble way because you want to be a member of heaven, you are not true to your self and you will drift away into darkness
# but when you serve in a humble way because you want to serve in a humble way, you are true to your self and will stand in bright light of heaven
# so we can not cheat against states of being or trade with them


### let's look what has changed in the relationship between you and your environment
# when our brain shutdown was successful, we have caused some cracks into the global spirit environment like a hatchling picks cracks into it's eggshell
# and through this little cracks we will percive new kinds of sensations we have to get used to
# and our brain will always try to render this sensations into something meaningful on its own
# but that's not what we want, because that would be just like watching scary and fearful brain television
# instead we want to stay so close to unrendered spirit as possible and learn to comunicate with it
# so whatever you see, hear or feel in a matter way or even emotionaly, that should not be there, don't give too much attention to it
# that does not mean that it's not there at all
# it does mean, that we have to learn to differ between matter impressions that your brain has created automaticaly
# and spirit impressions through your soul you have to translate into matter expressions on your own
# and where are intersections of both
# for example you may sense a weird person near you, that is actually the person in front of you, but you sense his true spirit first time in your life 
# and when you can't believe they are the same, then your brain will try to create another person for you
# so the more cracks your body armor has, the more transparent the bodys of others will be as well
# but you have to crack completely trough all your separation layers into your wake and opened eyes consciuosness, otherwise you will have to live with dreams or astral travels when it comes best, but you never really break through and see things as they really are


### let's create a servant environment
# when you move into your tabernacle you basically create a servant bubble within your self
# but when you are together with at least one or two, who are in a strong servant striving as well
# and all are in a similar state of being, the servant bubble can expand
# and you move together into the same spirit environment
# and experience an open vision where the matter curtain completely breaks
# and you are literaly standing with open eyes in the spirit realm
# so that you have a collective open vision
# but you can not enforce this servant bubble because all enforcements or obsessive behaviors belongs to a ruling striving
# and the more people you are, the more difficult it gets to move and stay in a similar state of being
# so the servant environment is like a very shy rabbit that instantly hops away into the bushes as soon as it get aware of any ruling striving


### Let's learn how to render spirit
# Heaven never command or judge you in any way
# instead heaven will always try to explain you how things work to become a better understanding
# and most likely you get a little loving touch in addition
# heaven teaches you by providing a view from states of being you have not jet discovered
# so it's pretty much like you do all day in matter life, when you walk around a thing to examine it from different angles of view
# and what you do with this knowledge afterwards is completely on you
# that means, when you do things that was not so nice, an angel may come and show you these things from different states of being to become a better understanding what you are doing and gives you a loving touch in addition
# and this is the only way to learn something in spirit, by moving into different states of being and get aware of the changes
# and of course you can abuse this heavenly behavior until heaven get aware that love make you worse
# so what we do now is some kinda dry run how to live in spirit
# for this we move into our tabernacle that is our most holy place we have
# and we do this with drawing in the most easiest way possible
# so the less experienced you are in drawing the better
# with this we learn how to differ brain thoughts from spirit impressions while being fully awake
# and it’s an extension of the brain workout you should do before for a view seconds
# and move into a humble state of being like an adorable kid and create a heavenly environment within yourself
# for this exercise you can use any material that leaves visible trails
# like flat stones to scratch on, Sand to draw in with your finger or a stick, or modern with paper and pencil
# but don’t show anyone your draws easily, because it is just a learning exercise of a very deep loving conversation and the risk to run into judgement from others is just too big
# so keep holy your drawings and show only well trusted persons
# while drawing don’t put your tool down and wait for commands, that will never happen, heaven never command anyone
# just keep moving in the same way as you are used to do in your normal life
# to become a better understanding imagine you have a pot with water and some ingredients in it, that is basically you
# you put the water on a stove to bring some warming love into it
# but don't make the water too hot, so that it begins to boil in emotions
# just like that you can see little bubbles of air of a loving servant presence on your humble ground, that's the best
# now take your spoon or your pencil and just stir it as gentle as possible to move the taste from the ingriedients into the water
# after a while you may feel, that you spoon or pencil feels more confident on some places than on others
# and wher you feel like that, give your tool a little more pressure
# so when this feelings come up, your spirit environment trys to help to discover yourself or whatever you focus on through some drawing around
# your spirit connection can become stronger and you may get a little dizzy
# but try to stay awake and look at everything in full consciousness
# so when you have a little feeling of it, than you have all you need
# and your feeling will become a little more shape with each try
# but every times you draw another picture of the same thing it will most likely look different
# this is because the knowledge or life experience you got from the prior images have become part of the reality you look at and change it's outcome
# but don't expect nice drawings, that's not the purpose of the exercise
# the purpose of the exercise is to learn the differences between the feeling you get from spirit and the predictions and expectations coming from your brain
# so the biggest challenge comes up, when you see first shapes of what you draw
# and your brain try to takeover the drawing and begin to draw it's own predictions
# that's because you have to do this exercise while being fully awake
# only that way you can get stronger against you biggest enemy, your own brain
# and only that way you learn to separate the spirit wheat from the chaff of your matter brain


### let's look how to pray
# we can not connect to spirit with our thoughts of our brain and talks of our body
# but thoughts and talks can help us to focus on what we are praying for
# to pray in spirit we have to move into our tabernacle
# and we can enter our tabernacle only in a state of a humble obedient little child
# so our tabernacle is our most private and most trusted holy place within us
# our tabernacle is our center dome of heaven within us 
# and there is no pride, no judgement, no hatred and no run for success
# but only unconditional trust, love and forgiveness
# so our tabernacle is the eye of the needle to heaven within us
# and the only forces that can press us into our tabernacle are desperation and hopelessness
# but once we have been pressed into it and found it we have become the ability to move into it without pressure from outside
# because our tabernacle is a state of being we have to discover
# but when we refuse the suffering that presses us into desperation and hopelessness we will never find it
# we have to go through desperation because nothing attracts love more than despair
# so to pray and attract love we have to move into a state of despair
# and our hopelessness describes what we are praying for


### let's learn to walk in spirit
# the first steps in spirit realm without a body protection suit is like walking bar feet over farmers fresh harrowed field or at least like walking naked on sand
# and when your feet are very thin skinned and have not jet made any experiences 
# they will send a hailstorm of potential dangerous sensations to your brain, that is completely overhelmed and unable to process all the informations
# and this owerhelming sensation of spirit feels like heaviness
# so the first steps into spirit will be very exausting and you will feel overtaxed and get tired very quickly
# but your feet will learn to handle the challenge on their own by developing reflexes and don't send everything to your brain anymore
# and your feet will develop a stronger skin and give you the ability to walk longer and on more strange terrains
# and the hailstorm of sensations becomes more kind, meaningful and clear shapes
# and you begin to get a true image of what is going on underneath your feet
# your feet will develop soft pads and you become the ability to walk even on hard stubborn tarrains without getting blisters
# your feet will become an even better bleed-supply, an even stronger skin and thicker pads to walk even on very hot and cold hearted terrains
# and you can handle even very heavy spirit without bursting out and spill over in emotions
# so gathering experiences is always an unpleasant task
# and there is always a risk to overburden yourself and get hurt very badly
# but you can not die and wounds will heal
# and the more experiences you gather, the more freedom you get


### let's exermine the difference between being obedient and being servant
# for obedience we need a ruler who pushes us around
# and we have to follow their commandments even if we don't understand the meaning
# so obedience we have to experience in our childhood or the first day
# but for being servant we have to understand the spirit of being servant
# to become the freedom to live the servant spirit in every way we like
# so there is a certain time of transformation in which we transform from being obedient into being servant
# and this time of transformation we call puberty which we have to experience on the second day
# so that someone who refused to be obedient in his childhood will barely become servant through the second day
# that's why we should honour our parents even if they behave like rulers
# but when the children has become majority there are no rulers needed any more
# and all former ruling parents should become fully servant again


### let's finally climb the mountain
# well, we allready did
# yes, that's it, so easy
# that's the good side on the what-causes-what riddle in spirit
# when you can't make the sun rising that causes the morning dew
# then just make some morning dew and the sun will rise
# so when you can't climb the mountain of gods love
# then just love anyhow and you begin to climb the mountain
# so when you don't understand the meaning of forgiveness
# then just try to forgive and you will begin to understand its meaning
# but you can not climb the mountain of love because of you
# and you can not enter heaven because of you
# so let me show you someone who has truly and fully understood what that means {play shelleys testimony}


### let's exermine the mountain
# the mountain on it's own is basically a meaningless solid rock of integrity of eternal life or the man part
# and everything that grows on it gives the mountain it's meaning or its beauty or the woman part
# but when the meaning overgrows the mountain it looses the connection to it's integrity
# then we tend to judge the meaning at one side and make the mountain stronger on the other side
# so the woman got hunted down into a servantship and man build himself up to a rulership
# and the spirit what-causes-what riddle makes it impossible to figure out what exactly is the reason for all the mess or to figure out how to find a peaceful solution
# so, are servants the reason for rulers or are rulers the reason for servants?
# does impurity cause judgement or does judgement cause impurity?
# does love cause forgiveness or does forgiveness cause love?
# does impurity cause judgement or does judgement cause impurity?
# can we ever experience the beauty of diversity without impurity?
# is impurity the source of the beauty of diversity?
# so who's fault is it when the mountain get buried underneath impurity just because it want's to enjoy the beauty of life?


### let's examine love and forgiveness
# love is the one that cares for everything that allready has become part of you
# but forgiveness is the fearless warrior that reaches out into the unknown darkness to conquer new territories
# so love cares allways for free and never expect anything in return
# but forgiveness bears everything and never bites back anyhow in return
# so love is like the caring mother of heaven by keeping its home in beauty
# but forgiveness makes heaven rich by gathering diversity from the wilds outside
# so love is the main strengrh of the woman in heaven
# but forgiveness is the main strength of the man in heaven


### let's examine the greatest enemys of heaven, love and forgiveness
# {take third image of ezekiel}
# the first enemy is love which connects us
# but when love becomes too intense we overheat and begin to melt and stick together
# and we get exausted and begin to hate love
# but hatred makes us sticking even more together
# and the second enemy is forgiveness which release us from each other
# but when forgiveness becomes too intense we become cold and begin to separate from each other
# and we get bored and begin to judge the eternal life
# but the worst we can do is to become lukewarm where we don't even feel the need to understand anything and come back to life again
# so the best we can do is to become an understanding how things work
# and become the ability to love and forgive limitless
# so when it becomes too hot, then armor yourself with gold of forgiveness and cool the armor down with ice of ignorance
# and when it becomes too cold, then throw away your armor and get in direct touch with your environment
# that way the greatest enemys of heaven become your best friends
# and we can release all breaks
# and move into limitless beauty and joy


### let's create a saint warrior of heaven
# for that we need some steel we melt with love out of the earth of common souls
# we put the steel into the furnace to heat it up with humble love full of minerals of divine wisdom just before it sparks in pride
# we put the hot steel on the anvil, spread some ashes of humiliation on it and hammer the humiliation with heavy blows of terror and torment into it
# we break the steel in half like a big mistake, fold it and hammer it together again until it lays down cold in despair
# we repeat this process of heating, humiliating, folding and hammering until we have thousands of layers in the steel that we call damast steel
# now we don't fold the steel any more, we only heat it up to hammer it into the final form like a katana sword from the ancient samurai
# we heat the steel up a last time until it is red like the morning star and throw it into cold water of ignorant life to harden it
# we hold it pretty warm for a while to settle it down in peace and comfort so that it can release from all tensions
# now the steel is hard like a diamond, swift and flexible like a feather and unbreakable like thin air
# finaly we grind and polish the sword razor sharp, add a handle and a sheath with some nice decorations to make it unique
# when your life look like this, you are one of the saints
# and when you ask why do we have to go through all this suffering
# because it is the only way to break unique and complete self consciousness beings out of the nothingness
# and the longer you stand on the anvil before moving into ruling to escape the suffering, the more freedom you will have
# and the more love you can stand before moving into pride, the more bliss you can have
# because eternity is a pretty long time that we don't want to waste with getting bored
# so beware to be lukewarm and not loadable, because you will have nothing then


### let's tell a little bedtime story about the difference between ruling and serving caring
# there is a ruler outside in the dark and cold wilds caring for his people
# then come across a house full of stinking garbage and bugs hiding in it
# and through a small hole of a window full of garbage shines a small light
# so he storms into the shabby house and yells, "Damned sinner, the dirt must come out or your house or judgement and hell full of hatred comes upon you!" 
# and the owner, scared to death, throws out all his trash
# and cleans up everything nice and shiny
# even his little fireplace he lit off because it stinks and produces dirty ashes
# but in his panic to freeze to death he notices that hatred is warm also
# on another place there is a servant in the dark and cold and caring for his people
# then come across a house full of stinking garbage and bugs hiding in it
# and through a small hole of a window full of garbage shines a small light
# so he went in carefully
# and in front of the fireplace the owner in tears of despair and observes his dying light
# so the servant gently asked the owner: what is all the rubbish for?
# and the owner answered: it isolates me from the cold
# and the servant asked: why not lit up your fireplace
# and the owner answered: i have forgotten how to do that
# and the servant said: but i know, so if you trust me i can help you on that
# and because the servant was so gentle, the owner trusted him 
# so they went out to collect some firewood
# and the owner learned how to lit up his fireplace
# but as he got more experiences on making fire he noticed, that all the rubbish burns very well also
# so even on the tip of the mountain we couldn't find the source of the fire we need for our new boat
# so let's move down into the bottomless pit of darkness
