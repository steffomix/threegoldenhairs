### let's prepare for climbing the mountain
# in the state of servant striving we dissolve in general awareness into our environment like a drop of water dissolves into an ocean
# or like two clean and undistorted mirrors who are looking into themselves
# and this deep reflection or general awareness cause the impression of light
# and in this light we get at first aware of everything, that is close to our state of being or have similar colors and enlightenment
# and the more we dissolve in general awareness, the more we get aware of colors, who are unlike us
# and we do this until we got aware of something we want to interact with
# and to be able to interact, we focus or collapse our awareness back and solid into an expression of ourselves
# in the colors or state of being we want to be
# in an appearance, that describes our behavior
# so the reason of interaction is like a mark, that grabs and holds our awareness as long as we allow it
# but when we get stuck in the awareness of a mark, we can not dissolve into a general awareness anymore
# and our mark or the reason that grabs our awareness turns into a mark of a beast
# because the reason of our awareness tries to hold us focussed to the reason
# and when we can not dissolve into general awareness anymore, everything becomes dark around us
# and when many souls get stuck in a state of collapsed awareness, they move into an forced relationship against each other
# and with the forced relationship they create the ruling environment
# and the only way to become some distant and freedom in a ruling environment is by repelling others
# but by reppelling everything becomes even darker
# so the only way to come together again in a ruling environment is by setting up rules of general or uniformed behavior
# but rules cause judgement
# and uniformed behavior means uniformed appearance
# but setting up general behaviors suppress the need of freedom even more
# and the suppressed freedom causes hatred against the suppressors and the suppressing environment
# and the suppressors try to suppress the hatred with judgement and even more rules
# so everything becomes more and more tight and compressed
# and everything begins to move against each other in a competitive way
# so that only who performs the most hatred against others becomes the most freedom
# and those who are not strong enougth or just refuse to hate and judge are crushed down into a pitchblack bottomless pit of infinite despair and hopelessness or second death
# from where nobody ever returned on his own
# until latelely
# and that changes everything
# so this day we learn how to move out of the bottomless pit, back into the heavens we once come from
# but because it's a long road, we need some food
# so let's move into the kitchen and make some white bread


### let's clean up the kitchen first to receive white flour first
# our kitchen, that's our brain works by predictions and expectations
# and walking by predictions and expectations means to walk by sight
# but in spirit we walk by trust
# and walking by trust means to walk without predictions or expectations
# so to cean up our kitchen means to remove everything that does not belong to spirit
# and that means to turn off all expectations and predictions or simply all thoughts, because predicting and expecting is the only thing our brain can do
# so we basically move our brain into a spirit state of being
# but we don't have to do that for long because spirit is timeless and transport informations within a fingersnip
# we have to do it as intense as possible
# and we have to do it while being fully awake with open eyes to make sure that the white flour of spirit is delivered directly into the kitchen and not into the cellar
# otherwise it would not only take ages to get the flour into our kitchen, it would get polluted with everything coming across the way
# so we just have to try to thing nothing for several seconds or minutes at maximum with all willpower we can bring together
# so we don't have be blurry lukewarm or we simply nothing


### let's create a spirit environment if not already created
# the spirit environment defines what kind of flour we want to receive
# so we should set up our environment before or at least while we clean up our kitchen
# for a loving environment the servant way just imagine it is early in the morning, the sun is croaching like a thief underneath the horizon and the morning clouds are gently settling down to bless the weak at first and the useless the most whereas the great and strong have deep roots to gather their blessings by themself, so that everything can grow up in peace and comfort safely
# for a loving environment the ruling way you summon dark clouds for heavy rain to break the weak and drown the useless, you summon fiery praying storms of judgement and heavy winds of hatred to blow all away that dares to be greater than you, so that everything get destroyed in performance and competition safely
# so let's repeat this with some images for a better understanding
# {serving environment [[angel-yeshua.png]]} for a loving environment the servant way just imagine it is early in the morning, the sun is croaching like a thief underneath the horizon and the morning clouds are gently settling down to bless the weak at first and the useless the most whereas the great and strong have deep roots to gather their blessings by themself, so that everything can grow up in peace and comfort safely
# {ruling environment [[angel-satana.png]]}  for a loving environment the ruling way just you summon dark clouds for heavy rain to break the weak and drown the useless, you summon fiery praying storms of judgement and heavy winds of hatred to blow all away that dares to be greater than you, so that everything get destroyed in performance and competition safely


### let's learn to shutdown the brain for just a moment
# to make sure we receive our flour directly into the kitchen or brain of being up and awake
# we have to be completely awake and have to keep our eyes open
# now we are searching for a high contrast point to look at
# something like a bright spot on a dark background or something we hold in our hand, so that all behind blurs, because it is more far away
# and we can even use just our finger
# now we try to think nothing, don't even have any emotion
# we only have our self created spirit environment that can be a little emotional
# and we try to think nothing with all willpower we can bring together for at least 30 seconds, but not longer than 10 minutes
# it will feel like a big ship driving sometimes through heavy storms and sometimes through calmy sea
# and we can do that in stages as if you are lifting heavy weights, like in regular muscle training
# or like a woman who has labor contractions
# so as said, the willpower you bring up is all that counts
# and you need to bring up that willpower from your soul
# so don't try to think to think nothing, that does not work
# when you are successful, you should become a little dizzy
# and you may even feel, that your spirit environment change a little
# and after a while you will have hard times to stay awake, because the need for sleep becomes overhelming
# and when you have problems with addictions or attractions of any kind, they will become very intense because you try to rip them off like an old sticky tape from the skin
# so addictions will become overhelming temporarily
# if so, just try to withstand as long as you can, before moving into hatred or judgement against your self
# and when you can't withstand any more or fall asleep, it's ok, nobody cleans a complete messed up house in just one strike
# and when you fell asleep and awake, you can be breathless or like under shock, because you was near dead for a little moment
# but you mostly will not instantly remember what you have experienced, because you brain needs time to render or translate your spirit experience into a matter story or images
# because in spirit we are only meaning and have to express or dress the meaning into a colorful form of behavior
# but in matter it's the opposite, the meaning is literally buried under countless expression layers
# so the only way to come back to spirit is to break through all this layers


### let's look what has happened in our kitchen
# {use mirror on mirror} for this we put two mirrors against each other
# and at one of them we remove a little from it's reflection layer
# and this little hole we look through is our origin, the observer
# when the mirrors are flat, paralel undistorted and clean, we can see a vast amount of reflections
# and all this reflections are reflections of ourselves
# and all this reflections are our spirit eyes
# and all this spirit eyes are our angels
# so the better your inner mirror works, the more depth becomes your spirit vision
# and the two main directions are the serving and the ruling strivings
# for example, when you look to much on yourself by putting this mirrors close together, you reduce your spirit vision and see only that hole
# but even if the hole is an impurity
# and even it is the source of all existence and all diversity you can not see on which side the impurity really is
# because this mirrors doesn't only cause a what-causes-what riddle, the cause a who-is-who riddle also
# so the only thing you can do is to repel the other mirror with the impurity to provide more room for all the reflections of ourselves and all it's diversity {global spirit environment [[global-spirit-environment.png]]}
# and turn them away from being parallel to create branches
# but there is no way to make the mirrors complete pure, because you would delete the observer that way
# and without an observer everything disappears into nothingness
# so the cause for all existence and all the mess that comes with it afterwards is the very first observer itself
# but who of all this reflections is it? Well, it's everyone
# so everyone and everything is infinite worthy
# therefore repelling can lead only into complete destruction


### let's look what has changed in our kitchen
# when or brain workout was successful, we have caused some cracks into the global spirit environment like a hatchling picks into it's eggshell
# and through this little cracks we will percive new kinds of sensations we have to get used to
# and our brain will always try to render this sensations into something meaningful on its own
# but that's not what we want, because that would be just like watching scary and fearful brain television
# instead we want to stay so close to unrendered spirit as possible and learn to comunicate with it
# so whatever you see, hear or feel in a matter way or even emotionaly, that should not be there, don't too much attention to it
# that does not mean that it's not there at all
# it does mean, that we have to learn to differ between matter impressions that your brain has created automaticaly
# and spirit impressions through your soul you have to translate into matter expressions on your own
# and where are intersections of both
# for example you may sense a weird person near you, that is actually the person in front of you, but you sense his true spirit first time in your life 
# and when you can't believe they are the same, then your brain will try to create another person for you
# so the more cracks your body armor has, the more transparent the bodys of others will become as well
# but you have to crack completely trough all your separation layers into your wake and opened eyes consciuosness, otherwise you will have to live with dreams or astral travels when it comes best, but you never really break through and see things as they really are


### Let's learn how to move in heavens kitchen
# Heaven never command or judge you in any way
# instead heaven will always try to explain you how things work to become a better understanding
# and most likely you get a little loving touch in addition
# heaven teaches you by providing a view from states of being you have not jet discovered
# so it's pretty much like you do all day in matter life, when you walk around a thing to examine it from different angles of view
# and what you do with this knowledge afterwards is completely on you
# that means, when you do things that was not so nice, an angel may come and show you these things from different states of being to become a better understanding what you are doing and gives you a loving touch in addition
# and this is the only way to learn something in spirit, by moving into different states of being and get aware of the changes
# and of course you can abuse this heavenly behavior until heaven get aware that love make you worse
# so what we do now is some kinda dry run for life in spirit
# for this we move into our tabernacle that is our most holy place we have
# and we do this with drawing in the most easiest way possible
# so the less experienced you are in drawing the better
# with this we learn how to differ brain thoughts from spirit impressions while being fully awake
# and it’s an extension of the brain workout you should do before for a view seconds
# and move into a humble state of being like an adorable kid and create a heavenly environment within yourself
# for this exercise you can use any material that leaves visible trails
# like flat stones to scratch on, Sand to draw in with your finger or a stick, or modern with paper and pencil
# but don’t show anyone your draws easily, because it is just a learning exercise of a very deep loving conversation and the risk to run into judgement from others is just too big
# so keep holy your drawings and show only well trusted persons
# while drawing don’t put your tool down and wait for commands, that will never happen, heaven never command anyone
# just keep moving in the same way as you are used to do in your normal life
# to become a better understanding imagine you have a pot with water and some ingredients in it, that is basically you
# you put the water on a stove to bring some warming love into it
# but don't make the water too hot, so that it begins to boil in emotions
# just like that you can see little bubbles of air of a loving servant presence on your humble ground, that's the best
# now take your spoon or your pencil and just stir it as gentle as possible to move the taste from the ingriedients into the water
# after a while you may feel, that you spoon or pencil feels more confident on some places than on others
# and wher you feel like that, give your tool a little more pressure
# so when this feelings come up, your spirit environment trys to help to discover yourself or whatever you focus on through some drawing around
# your spirit connection can become stronger and you may get a little dizzy
# but try to stay awake and look at everything in full consciousness
# so when you have a little feeling of it, than you have all you need
# and your feeling will become a little more shape with each try
# but every times you draw another picture of the same thing it will most likely look different
# this is because the knowledge or life experience you got from the prior images have become part of the reality you look at and change it's outcome
# but don't expect nice drawings, that's not the purpose of the exercise
# the purpose of the exercise is to learn the differences between the feeling you get from spirit and the predictions and expectations coming from your brain
# so the biggest challenge comes up, when you see first shapes of what you draw
# and your brain try to takeover the drawing and begin to draw it's own predictions
# that's because you have to do this exercise while being fully awake
# only that way you can get stronger against you biggest enemy, your own brain
# and only that way you learn to separate the spirit wheat from the chaff of your matter brain


### let's bring some more heat into your stove and create a servant bubble
# the earth is in a ruling striving
# and when you move into your tabernacle you basically create a servant bubble within your self
# but when you are together with at least one or two who are in a strong servant striving
# and all are in a similar state of being, the servant bubble can expand
# and you move together into the same spirit environment
# and experience an open vision where the matter curtain completely breaks
# and you are literaly standing with open eyes in the spirit realm
# so that you have a collective open vision
# but you can not enforce this servant bubble because all enforcements or obsessive behaviors belongs to a ruling striving
# and the more people you are, the more difficult it gets to move and stay in a similar state of being


### let's look how to pray
# we can not connect to spirit with our thoughts of our brain and talks of our body
# but thoughts and talks can help us to focus on what we are praying for
# to pray in spirit we have to move into our tabernacle
# and we can enter our tabernacle only in a state of a humble obedient little child
# so our tabernacle is our most private and most trusted holy place within us
# our tabernacle is our center dome of heaven within us 
# and there is no pride, no judgement, no hatred
# but only unconditional trust, love and forgiveness
# so our tabernacle is the eye of the needle to heaven within us
# and the only forces that can press us into our tabernacle are desperation and hopelessness
# but once we have been pressed into it and found it we have become the ability to move into it without pressure from outside
# because our tabernacle is a state of being we have to discover
# but when we refuse the suffering that presses us into desperation and hopelessness we will never find it
# we have to go through desperation because nothing attracts love more than despair
# so to pray and attract love we have to move into a state of despair
# and our hopelessness describes what we are praying for


### let's examine the difference between the servant heaven and the ruling hell
# heaven is nothing about you but all about your environment
# so you can not enter heaven because of you
# hell is all about you but nothing about your environment
# so when you is everything for you, then you are in hell
# and when you enter whatever church or religion because of you, you go straight to hell
# but when you enter whatever church or religion to serve in a humble way, you go straight to heaven
# but when you serve in a humble way because of heaven you go straight to hell
# but when you serve in a humble way because you love to serve in a humble way, you go straight to heaven
# because you can not cheat against states of being
# and you can not trade with states of beings


# let's look how things in heaven work
# in heaven all we need literaly condensates out of nothing in the most gentle way possible
# this is because everything is in a servant striving and loves to serve the needs from others
# and there is nowhere a need to present ourselves as a great server
# so that all who feel a need, try to serve the need in a hidden or at least most humble way possible
# this is because in heaven we know that all focus on ourselves disturbs our inner mirror and cause darkness, disturbance and destruction
# and we know, that we cause a mark of awareness by putting ourselves into the focus of others and reduce their vision as well
# so in heaven it's all about god and that is just everything that surround us
# and once you understood this, it should be no problem to server others like that in your very own way
# or just enjoy the beauty of heaven like the gras waves in the mild sommerwinds
# so whatever you do in heaven, nobody will judge you for that
# as long you keep holy the spirit of heaven and don't do anything that destroys it
# so you can not enter heaven because of your self but only because you love to serve like all in heaven



### Let's transform simple water into a purified essence of life with a servant striving 
# {take a bottle of water} air means servant striving, water means ruling striving
# due to its contradicting nature and the lack of integrity between both a stormy relationship begins
# water vaporates into the air, and air get cought down into the water
# the air becomes clouds and it begin to rain and the water becomes like boiling 
# so that there develops a great storm and the heavens begin to drown in water
# in their despair the heaven build up a strong being, who was able to keep holy the air against the water 
# and became like a boat through this to pick up all servant life and settled down the storms that way
# but every time the storms came back they got stronger
# and the heavens had to find a new way, to get water from a place where it is ready to turn into air and become a member of heaven


### Let's create a simple device to explain this
# take two cups and tape them together like this {tape together two cups}
# now make a bottomless pit into it {make a hole in the two cups and connect two bottles with it}
# when this water drips through the hole it creates another isolation layer
# like a more complex body that shields the spirit from the global spirit environment
# but when we look into the next stage we see that it is just a repeat or a reflection of the situation we allready had before
# the only difference is the distance to it's source
# and to become an idea how often this already have been done, just look at the very early stages {show image of an atom}
# and every time we turn around the bottles for another chance it get only worse
# but one completely insane guy managed to move all the way down while keeping holy his servant striving and returned back to heaven
# that way he created a spirit tunnel {create a vortex in the bottel}
# but through the tunnel all the knowledge from heaven came into this deep isolation also
# and increased the development of even more isolated bodys rapidly
# this new bodys will not be based on water any more because the isolation is going to break
# the new bodys will be based on fire
# so we have to create a complete new tunnel into a state of being that have all separation layers in common
# that way we create a tunnel that works on all stages no matter how deep it will ever get


### let's enhance this simple device with a peacemaker
# we in a body are literaly living walking universes of beings
# and our relationship to it is basicaly a ruling one
# and we are isolated in our body through an unbelievable amount of matter layers
# and the only gap we have left to reconnect with spirit is water
# so water is the only element that reacts on spirit because it is made out of the most early separation layers
# but for that the water has to be pure and undistorted
# otherwise the spirit influence behaves like looking through a violent water surface
# and everything we percive is completely messed up
# to make it worse, distorted water does not move free anymore, become hard and sticky and cause several diseases {show the marbel machine demagnetizer video}
# so in ancient times the protection through the magnetic field was enougth
# and dirtortions came basically from the food we eat
# but in our modern times with all the electronics and radiations we are bypassing the natural protection shield from earth
# so that the main distortions come from the water itself today, especialy in citys and fasting becomes nearly useless that way
# to compensate this and enforce the natural magnetic field, we add some magnets around the vortex, where it rotates the fastest
# so just add them anyhow to the simple device {show simple device with peacemaker}
# magnets you find everywhere today, like in bicycle dynamos, hard drives, magnetic pins for notes or even in door seals from old fridges for example
# use this now about ten times and drink as much as possible at once to literaly flood your body with purified water
# but when you create purified water, you should contemplate a servant striving or state of being into it
# you do it just by looking at it while being in a very intense state of being you want to have in the water
# so don't be lukewarm and learn to move into powerful states of being on will even when there is strong influence from whatever source
# and when you are very sensitive allready you should sense a response like a reflection of your state of being coming from the water
# and the first effects after a view days will be a very enhanced life energy 
# and a very enhanced vision into the global spirit realm of your striving or state of being you contemplated into the water
# and it can become that strong that you become completely unable to sin against what you have contemplated into it
# but due to it's strong effects to your brain you may become intense headache or feeling like under electricity power first times
# and due to the better flow of purified water old muskle tensions can release, that can be very painful first


### let's finally climb the mountain
# well, we allready did
# yes, that's it, so easy
# that's the good side on the what-causes-what riddle in spirit
# when you can't make the sun rising that causes the morning dew
# then just make some morning dew and the sun will rise
# so when you can't climb the mountain of gods love
# then just love anyhow and you begin to climb the mountain
# so when you don't understand the meaning of forgiveness
# then just try to forgive and you will begin to understand its meaning
# but you can not climb the mountain of love for yourself
# so let me show you someone who has truly and fully understood what that means {play shelleys testimony}


### let's exermine the difference between being obedient and being servant
# for obedience we need a ruler who pushes us around
# and we have to follow their commandments even if we don't understand the meaning
# but for being servant we have to understand the spirit of being servant
# to become the freedom to live the servant spirit in every way we like
# so there is a certain time of transformation in which we transform from being obedient into being servant
# and this time of transformation we call puberty
# so that someone who refused to be obedient in his childhood will barely become servant but very likely ruling
# that's why we should honour our parents even if they behave like rulers
# but when the children has become majority there are no rulers needed any more
# and all former ruling parents should become fully servant again


### let's exermine the mountain
# the mountain on it's own is basically a meaningless solid rock of integrity of eternal life or the man part
# and everything that grows on it gives the mountain it's meaning or the woman part
# but when the meaning overgrows the mountain it looses the connection to it's integrity
# then we tend to judge the meaning at one side and make the mountain stronger on the other side
# so the woman got hunted down into a servantship and man build himself up to a rulership
# and the spirit what-causes-what riddle makes it impossible to figure out what exactly is the reason for all the mess or to figure out how to find a peaceful solution
# so, are servants the reason for rulers or are rulers the reason for servants?
# does impurity cause judgement or does judgement cause impurity?
# does love cause forgiveness or does forgiveness cause love?
# does impurity cause judgement or does judgement cause impurity?


### let's examine what is sin
# when spirit impressions becomes too strong we feel the need to put something between the impressions and us
# so we are going to create a hide that shields us and we feel more comfortable, secure and peaceful in the same way we protect us with clothes against unpleasant weather conditions
# but when we go so far, that the hide becomes the meaning of our life
# and we completely forget all about our spirit source of life, we will run into serious trouble
# so there is nothing bad on protecting against spirit impressions
# but we should allways be able to release our hide of protection as soon as it is not needed any more


### let's tell a little bedtime story about how purity can be the source of hatred and judgement
# there is a man outside, it's dark and cold and you're almost frozen
# but then he see a house in front of him
# it is full of garbage and bugs and it stinks 
# and from the full garbaged windows shines through a small hole a little light
# and the whole house radiates a very little warmth
# but he storms into the shabby house and yells, "Damned sinner, the dirt must come out or your house or you go to hell!" 
# and the owner, scared to death, throws out all his trash
# and clean up everything nice and shiny
# even his little fireplace he lit off because it stinks and produces dirty ashes
# but in his panic to freeze to death he notices that hatred is warm also
# after a while he came back to the now clean and shiny house and ask for a warm fireplace
# but the owner yells, "My house is way too clean and shiny for such a dirty and even dangerous fireplace. Get out of here and look for warms elsewhere!"
# so he went away thinking about his mistake and came across of another house
# the door was wide open
# so he went into the shabby house full of garbage and stinky dirt and bugs croached around everywhere
# and in front of the fireplace the owner sits mourning in tears and observes his dying light, long forgotten how to light it up
# the man ask the owner what all the garbage is for?
# and the owner says: it isolates against the cold
# but this time he say: come on, there's firewood outside to rekindle your fire
# then you won't need so much rubbish any more and you'll get rid of the bugs hidden in it
# if you like, I can help you with that


### let's end the second day
# on the first day we explored the land and  learned much how things work
# but at the end we had more questions than answers
# on the second day we climbed the mountain and learned much about how to move
# but at the end we can not enjoy the beauty of heaven while our beloved suffer in agony
# so we have to take a peace of bread and water,, put it on a secure place
# and walk all the way down to the other side into the bottomless pit of darkness, despair and hopelessness to get all out of there whoever want to
