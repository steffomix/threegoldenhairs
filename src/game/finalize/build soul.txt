### So just if you wonder why i am reading all this
# it's because it is the only way to grind and polish expressions of spirit informations
# it is the same thing like drawing, where you sharpen the contures and erase all the distorted waste
# until you have a brittle brilliant and razor sharp image
# and that's what we need
# when we have reached the third day of majority
# where we become full responibilty for what we are doing
# so there is no messing around any more


--- needs book of life
--- needs draw tools
### let's create a soul from heaven by using my staff you have seen at the very beginning
# there is a scripture with 3 sections or days and 7 seals and 7 mirrors
# so we draw a seven edged area
# and this area represents the first day
# or your childhood
# and we call this area 7 mountains of love
# and the way how you place your goods or your love - that are your life experiences - into this area builds up your striving
# so you can be obedient against rulers, that are your parents in the first place
# to build mostly servant life experiences
# or you can rule or just be disobedient against others, that are your parents in the first place
# to build most likely ruling life experiences
# so basicly you can not build servants without rulers and rulers without servants
# because in your body you behave like free moving magnets
# where rulers attract servants 
# and servants attract rulers
##and where rulers repell rulers by punish them and judge them as demons
# and servants repell servants by comforting them with love and let them go their ways in forgiveness
# but in spirit, without a body we are like a part of one big magnet
# or like a cell in our body
# and barely come in contact with the other striving
## so when we now look into the book of life
# then we see that we need an intersection of the states of being
# to come together
# and thats how families are connected with their future childrens
# so you see, that when a huge community draws down more and more into the darkness
# the chance of heavenly souls reduces through lack of intersections in the states of beings
# so that dark souls barely will bring light souls to birth
## however, when the parents are strong rulers, there is at least a chance
# that the children become servants through them
# so that the matter life on earth has some kind of self balancing abilities


### however, when you are a ruling soul, your overall development ends in the childhood
# your inner emtyness let you strive to the very outside
# where you find security through your strength and greatness
# so that your ruling nature becomes the way to protect yourself
# but that works only as long as you see a chance for success
# in the competition against others
# who do it the same way


### but when you belong to the servant striving, you will try to find security within yourself
# and begin to develop a most inner holy place where you feel secure amd confident
# and seal it with the most gentle, loving and all forgiving shields or seals you can ever create
# as a barrier to become unbreakable from within
# but to do so, you have to sacrifice some space of your outside beauty and greatness
# to have a place where your soul will live and defines it's meaning of life
# and this happens usually during your puberty


### so let's draw another 7 edged area into the allready defined area
# that is your second day of puberty
# or your sealed ring-like shield to your most holy place you have not discovered jet
## so during this time of puberty you finally move into your dressed up body 
# and have to deal with it, wheras a ruling soul 
# always stays asideof his body, like not really there
# so that there never a development of the soul takes place
# so when you - as part of the childrens environment - have managed to dress up a servant body for a ruling soul 
# you will be pretty surprised what a troublemaker you have all of the sudden
# but when you have managed to build up a ruling body for a servant soul
# you will have someone who most likely jump from the bridge to get rid of this unbearable thing


### so in the second day you basicly define your seals to protect your most inner holy place
# that defines the way you want to live
# and because - this can only happen to servant souls
# and we want to build a real strong soul soul
# we can call this area hallway of ark angels
# where ark stands for unbreakable
# and "hallway" because it is an area that protects your holy place 
# from everything that does not match the seals
# so this hallway works like a last frontier, that mediates to your most inner holy place


### but to discover the third day, that is our most holy place
# is not so easy
# because it is the place where we are connected directly with the source of life
# and it may sound strange
# but the source where we all come from is death
# so we have to face a terrifying environment
# and stay unbreakable servant in it
# to get literaly pressed backwards into the state of being 
# from where we all come from 
# a second time
# that is second death
# and this spirit death is a state of infinite despair and hopelessness
# wich is the state of being before all creation
# or where god will end up without you
# that's why god loves you so much
##
# and then you can't lookat anything anymore without seeing a reflection of yourself
# and the walls of your most inner holy place turns from glas into mirrors
# and every seal of your shield turns into broken doors
# and the love, that shines through the doors makes all impurities invisible and insignificant
# and your forgiveness breaks through all walls and mirrors as if there is nothing
# to bless every expression of your existence
# no matter what


### so let's draw all this
# there is the hallway of of ark-angels
# with the seals in the broken doors
# the light-beams of love
# the rivers of forgiveness
# that's where all the water comes from


### so when you now look at this construction
# it looks a bit like a blossom
# with the petals of your childhood 
# that expresses your life experiences
# and describes your ubique soul
# the anthers as your holy seals that describes our your striving based on your life experiences
# and the ovary as your most holy place in where you discovered your oneness with all everything
# so that only one
# who has a similar signature as you
# can enter it
# to create together the ovule, that is your most holy place
# where the tears from heaven
# filled with love and forgiveness
# fall from the sky
# to bless the purified waters coming from below
## well, you may not understand all that right now
# but wait, it's on the way


### so let's make an overview how it looks like right now
# there are 7 petals and 3 circles
# the outer heaven as the 7 mountains of love
# the inner heaven as the hallway of the ark angels
# and the most inner holy place with the source of life
# that are the never ending streams of forgiveness
# there are the 7 doors
# with the light beams of love through all 3 circles
# and in the broken doors to the most inner holy place we put the seals
# lying on the ground


### and the seals we make like that:
# one outer layer of thick and cleaned glass
# with the first day transparent engraved into it
# so that you can barely see, but feel it from the outside
# underneath the second day
# engraved in thick glass 
# and filled with white color of undiscovered wisdom of heaven
# and underneath of it a mirror out of thick glass
# with the third day engraved from behind through the reflecting layer of the mirror
# and instead of the seven mirrors on my shepherd staff
# the witness of the second day shall choose a name once and forever
# and around all the glass and mirrors put 4 mirrors with 12 holes 
# and put 12 lights behind them to shine into the seals
# and make a frame out of brass of hope of forgiveness 
# with 12  7-edged stars out of red glass of love around it
# where the light of the 12 lights shines through it to the outside
# and screw front and back together with 4 big screws on each edge
# gentle round from the upside as the four gentle winds of the 4 cardinal skydirections of heaven
# where peace and comfort pave your way to discover all faces of love and forgiveness
# but ruff and nasty from the bottom side as the 4 storms of the 4 cardinal skydirections of hell
# where performance and competition pave your way to discover all faces of hatred and judgement
# and make 7 screws on the top and bottom of medium size
# gentle round from the upside  as the 7 seals of heaven
# but ruff and nasty from the bottom side as the 7 courses of hell
# and make 10 little screws at the left and right
# gentle round from the upside as the 10 commandments of your childhood to be forgiven
# but ruff and nasty from the bottom side as the 10 commandments of childhood to be your judgement
# and put the seals in that direction on the ground
# that you have to go down on your knees 
# and look in a servant caring way from
# the inside of your most holy place to the outside
# to be able to read them
# and put them half into the doors and half in the hallway
# and on the backside engrave a ruff big cross
# to remind all those who are looking at it
# why they are not in heaven


### and the morning star make like a tear drop of love and forgiveness falling down from heaven
# for that make it like my shepherd staff, but cut of the first day
# and replace it with a solid line, made out of gold of forgiveness
# and instead of wood, make a conic hose out of silver of purity
# and hammer in the seven mirrors of awareness
# fill the conic hose with ashes of humility and hammer it in 
# and give the ashes a gentle moisture
# so that it does't fall of from alone
# then write the second and third day with leaf gold of forgiveness on it 
# like a gentle touch
# and polish it all to perfect brilliance
# then mold cleaned glass of Gods tears 
# and mix in some dust of diamonds of angels from heaven
# and pour it over the staff
# so that it looks like a long tear drop of the holy spirit from heaven
# and let it hang down from the center top of your most holy place
# with the line made out of gold of forgiveness from the first day
# to remind you
# that when you can't take it anymore
# and your forgiveness breaks
# a humble tear drop of pure love
# filled with gold of forgiveness
# is raining down from the sky
# to give you consolation and comfort
# and gently remind you to not throw away the holy spirit of heaven 


### now take water of hopeless and desperate souls
# from a deep well underneath your most holy place
# and let it run through your simple device several times 
# underneath the floor of the most holy place
# to clean it from all distress
# and let it run into a little shell like pond in the center of your most holy place
# from where it runs through the broken mirrors
#  through little holes in the corners of the mirror walls
# through your hallway of ark-angels
# into the gardens of heaven
# and call them seven rivers of forgiveness
# and all the water that you can not find a usage for
# let run to the outside 
# and let it sink back to where it comes from

-- needs handy for image --
### so lets draw a sketch of all this and add shields against magnetizing influences
# so there is the most holy place whith the morning star
# hanging down from the center top
# floating over the little mold, filled with purified water
# and the simple devices underneath to free the water from all distress
## the 7 mirror walls around
# broken 10 times from the bottom to the top to forgive the 10 commandments of your childhood
# which are needed only during the first day
# afterwards go like this:
# when your environment has become so poor, that someone needs to steal for whatever reason, who's fault is it?
## then we have the seven doors with the seals that are broken out of the walls from inside out
# and lying half in the doors and half in the hallways of the ark angels
# then we have the 7 mountains of love as the body of heaven 
# with everything that is good and healthy in several rings like year-rings of a tree
# and underneath of all that are running invisible the seven rivers of forgiveness
# with a little well in each ring of each mountain of love
# so that the more high the mountains of love are
# the more deep you have to dig to find the never ending rivers of forgiveness
# or where the mountains of love becomes low
# the waters of forgiveness comes to the surface
# so that you never ever come in touch with the ruling striving again
# and there are the 7 lightbeams of purifying love with the entrys to heaven at the end
# and an image from the outside with the two witnesses of love and forgiveness
# and the morning star in the center
# the blue sky to breathe vaporized love
# and the green grass of comfort at the bottom


### now shield the dome with a faradaic cage all around
# and shield the hallway of the ark angels  a  2. times with another faradaic cage all around
# and shield all  a 3. times with a faradaic cage all around
# and the whole building has no doors you can close
# not even the 7 most outside entrys have doors
# but keep the entrys and the doors between the days as small as possible to not destroy the shields


### so, this building is the representation of a soul from heaven
# and it describes how difficult it is to change your striving into it's opposide
# you literally have to destroy everything that does not belong to heaven
# so when I give a hellish soul water that is blessed with the spirit from heaven
# it has the potential to completely destroy him 
# or causes at least pain and illness
# because it destroys everything what this soul is living for from inside out
# all the good life experiences turns out to be bad
# and all your bad life experiences turns out to be good
# so you most likely can not drink it
# it tastes terrifying or something within you strives against it to drink it
# so changing your striving can mean to complete destroy your soul
# down to your bare naked sensation of existence
# that means death of yourself
# by going through second death
# of infinite despair and hopelessness
# and get reborn as a new soul and begin from start
# but don't understand this as a matter switch
# it is a spiritual switch
# and to be able to switch you have to understand to where you have to switch to
# so you have to understand how things work in heaven
# and how things work in hell
# to be able to switch into one of them

 
# so let's look how the command hirarchy works in heaven
# well, in heaven we do not command
# in heaven we provide opportunities
# but the responsibility of the given opportunity stays on the provider
# so that the one who become and grab an opportunity can grow in love
# and don't have to fear any consequences if he fails
# but if he fails, the provider can grow in forgiveness first
# and in love aftereards by executing the opportunity by himself
# so in heaven you should not provide opportunities, you can not handle by yourself
# or fix the damage that the one caused who has become the opportunity you provided
# so when you become and execute an opportunity from heaven
# but forward it to another one
# the responsibility stays on you
# therefore all in heaven is given by grace
# because he who gives it, see the potential in you to make it
# and when you make it, you can make it fully free, without any restrictions or limitations
# the only limitation you have is your potential
# and of course you can ask your provider for guidance
# but you can not expect guidance
# because expectations are nothing more than the result of predictions of your brain
# so whatever you expect that spirit should do, will never be served
# because in spirit we can walk only by trust, there is no prediction possible
# the only thing you can do is to pray by moving into desperation
# and let you hopelessness describe what you are praying for
## therefore no desperation and no hopelessness -- no help
# sounds hard, but desperation and hopelessness are just states of being like any other
# and once you learned to move into them, it isn't that hard anymore as it sounds in the first place
# and it is handled that way to make sure you really tried with all of your potential
# only that way you can grow in trust the most
# and only that way you can grow into a fully self aware and limitless being 
# and extend your potentials the most
# even if it sometimes means to face suffering or even go to the brink of death


### so I have 4 opportunities to give away
# the first is for the witness of love we have seen at the end of the second day
# to make you a morning star of any size you like
# but instead of glass you can use resin or some layers of paint color with a little glitter effect
# and you can use charcole instead of ashes, because it's easier to handle
# and you can use aluminium instead of silver and it doesn't even have to be conic
# and instead of gold leaf you can use a goldish looking pen
# then make sheath and a belt to wield your morning star like a sword
# but never punish stonehearted with it to make them repent in tears
# this sword is a guidance for you and for everyone who want to look at it
# but never force someone to do so or wield it too openly
#  to be end up as sharkfood or make mockers worse
# so make a sheath you can only partially look through
# you need this guidance, because you have the potential to watch over 7 mountains, the body of heaven
# but don't reach out on your own for someone to help you
# just sit and wait until someone comes to you
# if nobody comes, enjoy your free time
# and if someone want to build it without you, let them try 
# and when they struggle, don't help them
# let them go in forgiveness
# and let them fall into my hands 
# of infinite despair and hopelessness
# but for the case someone please you humble for guidance
# and you don't know how it should look in detail
# just let 7 mountains look like a christmas tree full of presents from heaven


### the second opportunity goes to the second witness of forgiveness
# we have seen at the end of the third day
# to make you another morning star just like the first witness of love
# and I want you to watch over the center dome, 7 rivers, 7 beams of light, the 7 entrys of heaven and the 7 seals, the wells in the mountains of love and the shields
# so basically everything that does not belong to 7 mountains of love
# but you will have to respect, how much room the first witness of love is willing to give you
# so if the second witness of love decides to make it all alone, enjoy your free time
# but if love gives you room
# let the first witness of love decide the name in the  3. layer of the 7 seals in the 2. day
# that will replace the 7 mirrors of the morning star because there is allready all mirror in the 3. layer of the seals
# and when love decides to overgrow your forgiveness as something useless
# let love try 
# and when love struggles, don't help until love is completely beaten down by hatred
# and is lying down in despair an hopelessness


### but for all
# even if the morning star is the most fearsome deamon-slayer imaginable
# it is not it's purpose
# it's a staff of guidance
# that become it's power by going in line with it
# but every time you use it to hunt down and cast out deamons
# you move into some hatred
# and move out of the alignment of the morning star
# and the morning star becomes literaly dull, dark and useless
# so don't punish stone-heated people with it 
# to force them into tears of repentence
# the morning star is not a staff of judgement that I wield
# I am the only one who has authority for judgement
# because I am the only one who can catch the consequences
# so depending on what striving you look at my staff
# you see a shephert staff of guidance
# or a sword of judgement
# that's why the spirit of heaven on my staff 
# is written with my very own fire of repentence


### let's figure out where to build all this 
# all matter reality is an expression of the meaning of spirit life
# but when you focus too much on the expressions of the meaning
# you easily bury the meaning underneath the expression
# and get lost in a meaningless life
# so you can indeed build all this anywhere 
# and even in multiple ways in the matter world
# but when you loose track of it's meaning
# you get buried underneath meaningless expressions of life
# your entire life becomes meaningless
# and you will begin to hate your meaningless life
# and will begin to repell everything meaningless in judgement
# until everything is destroyed within you
# and you die the second death 
# and fall into my hands of judgement
# to become an angel, a reflection of me
# and experience the difference between freedom and free will
## so the most favorite place where you should build all this is within yourself
# and only then, when it has become a solid ground within yourself
# and has been proofed to stand all storms
# so that this building and you has become unbreakable one
# then you can build it into the world as a memento of your conquest

### let's look deeper into love and forgivenes
# when you love, you give something away from you 
# or spend comfort for others
# but don't expect anything in return
## when you forgive, someone has something taken away from you
# or others have hurt you
# but you don't want to take or do something in return
## so love and forgiveness are the same
# the only difference is the opposide point of view
# or the opposide directions of action and reactions
## but look at this
# you forgive also
# when others gives you something from themself or spend you comfort
# but you don't feel the dept to give or do something in return
## so even if love and forgiveness are the same
# love is only a part of forgiveness
# therfore there are two heavens
# the lower heaven of love
# and the higher heaven of forgiveness
## in the lower heaven of love 
# you always have some sensation of dept or have problems to deal with unpleasant things
# so that there is comfort
# but not fully peace
# because without the full understanding of forgiveness
# you can't even receive anything without causing some sensation of dept
# so love is allready an expression of forgiveness
# and therefor the lower heaven
# where all the nice expressions of forgiveness standing around
# and when we look at our building
# we see the most high heaven in the center dome, the most holy place
# surrounded by a mediator
# a last frontier medium
# that is able to stand the full light beam of purity from the heaven of forgiveness
# and mediates between the both heavens
# because from the point of view of the most holy place
# I don't care about all the expressions in the lower heaven of love
# behind the mirrors
# because the only thing that I can see through the mirrors
# is what your heart is striving for


### 

--- need picture of four winds 
--- need picture of book of life with both tunnels
--- need spirit compass
### but let's look a bit deeper into the four winds of spirit realm
# here you see the servant striving of heaven
# and here the ruling striving of hell
# and when spirit winds move you out of forgiveness
# you can move into love, judgement or despair
# or when spirit winds move you out of hatred
# you can move into love, judgement or despair
# or when spirit winds move you out of judgement
# you can move into hatred, forgiveness or despair
# or when spirit winds move you out of love
# you can move into forgiveness, hatred or despair
# like this guy --- picture of book of life with both tunnels
# he moved from the lower heavens of love
# into the lower hell of hatred
# and back through forgiveness while he got beaten to death
# that's how he created this spirit tunnel
# and with it a spirit connection in both sides
# from the ruling striving of hell into the servant striving heaven 
# through matter life
# but because of some lack of forgiveness
# he didn't manage to hit the center
# and some fall through his judgement
# but there isn't anything bad on it
# because you can not make such deep tunnels in one strike
# without risking to get lost in darkness
## imagine you are looking for some friends
# who got lost in deep woods
# so you have to move into the woods as well to find them
# but all your effort is wasted
# when you don't find back and get lost also
# so it's better to explore the woods step by step
# and put a little sign for orientation on each step
## look, when you look at a forest on a mountain from distance
# it all looks easy - just follow the striving of up and down
# but when you are *in* the forest
# and don't even know any more why you are there
# things can become very complicated
## you have buried yourself into your expressions of life
# and lost connection to spirit realm
# and with loosing your connection to spirit realm
# your spirit compass as shown on the first day did become useless
# and you forgot the purpose of your life on earth
# so you did the obvious
# and began to build things that made your meaningless life at least easier
# and managed to build really fascinating devices that way
# that became so complicated
# to become a life simulation on it's own
# but because it's life-essence is based on fire
# what do you think
# to what will it lead you?


### let's go around the four winds
# love is a child of forgiveness
# and as long love finds it's servant home in forgiveness
# love is able to release from it's plays and adventures
# but when love has gone lost in it's adventures
# it can't find home anymore
# and love becomes desperate
# and love try to destroy everything that could be a hindrance to find home
# and move into hatred that way
## but when many come together in hatred
# things can become very complicated
# and the lost and desperate love trys to solve the problems with rules and judgement
# but judgement makes the sensation of being lost in isolation even worse
# and love gives up 
# and becomes calm in desperation and hopelessness
# and with it comes back
# peace of forgiveness


### let's look into the difference between man and woman
# the womans love is the expression of the mans forgiveness
# but when womans beauty of mans forgiveness has problems to let go from her love
# the man can move into judgement and draw his beauty into hatred with it
# and lead her into endless terror of competition and performance in consequence
# or he can remind his beauty of the meaning of love and forgiveness
# and lead her into endless joy of peace and comfort in consequence


--- needs book of life with tunnels
### let's look at the petals of the blossom
# they are the body of the soul
# and in a ruling striving 
# or at night in darkness
# they are closed and work like an armor
# but in a servant striving
# or at day in sunlight
# they are opened to express the beauty of gods forgiveness, that is love
# but love can overdo to express it's beauty
# and the petals run dry in forgiveness
# the given love can not be forgiven anymore
# and the need to love back begin to rise up
# and with the need to love back
# begins the measurement of the given love
# and with the measurement comes up the need of something
# that expresses the result of the measurement
# and the expression of the measurement result you call money
# and with money the need for stockpiling money rises up
# and with stockpiling money, envy rises up
# and with envy, the need for protection rises up
# and the blossom close it's petals
# and evetything becomes dark and ugly
# and love dies
# and with the dying love, hatred rises up
# and with hatred the need for rules rises up
# and with rules the need for judgement rises up
# and with hatred, rules and judgement
# the need for more petals for protection rises up
# and to protect yourself against others you took things like
# locks, armor, weapons
# but also makeup, drugs, habits
# and everything that distracts from yourself
# because it is you, who has exchanged forgiveness with money
# and became a moneychanger
# and made your life dark, poor and meaningless
-- point to the other guy on book of life
## so this guy told you to love
# to forgive
# and to not serve dead petals 
# and cut them off and let them go instead
# like blossoms used to do


### look at this little extended book of life
# here you see the servant striving spirit realm of heaven
# here around the matter reality, that isolates you from the strivings
# and here the ruling striving spirit realm of hell
# and somewhere here outside this other guy created a connection between both sides
# so that you can enter heaven in a very easy way
# but when you don't want that
# and destroy all matter life that is based on water instead
# you will have to go through my created tunnel in the very center
## but to reach it, all your pride has to get humbled down to infinite despair and hopelessness
# and everything that does not belong to heaven has to be destroyed
# and that can mean in the worwst case
# that your soul can get destroyed down to the consciousness of a drop of water
# before you are able to enter heaven


### let's look what you are like with a little selftest in formof an ancient story
# and HE asked 3 of his friends: "Compare me to something and tell me what I am like."
# and  the first one said, "You are like a righterous angel."
# and the second one said, "You are like a wise philosopher."
# and the last one said, "Teacher, my mouth is utterly unable to describe what I am looking at."
# and HE said to the last one, "I am not your teacher. 
# because you have drunk, 
# you have become intoxicated 
# from the bubbling spring that I have tended."
# and continued silently:

listen:
>>># whenever you want to know who and what you are like
>>># then just examine everything around you
>>># and whatever you can see *within* everything - is a reflection of yourself

# and the others wanted to know what HE told him silently
# but the last one answered:
# when I tell you what he spoke to me, 
# you will percieve it as judgement
# due to your ruling striving
# and you will throw stones on me
# and they will return to you as fiery brimstones
## but when you are in a servant striving
# you will be encouraged
# to bless everything with the holy spirit of heaven
# you have discovered within yourself
## and when you enter heaven
# two heavens merge together
# and double it's beauty of diversity
# and in the same way you enjoy heaven
# heaven enjoys you


--- need simple device
### let's create some angels
#  it works best outside in nature where you have a better spirit connection than in houses by default
# you have to look at it while doing it
# to get some connection to what you are blessing
# the same is when you bless people
# you need to create a connection to your target
# and this connection can be established even over a third being like a spirit guide
# or a person who knowed the person
# but in both cases the soul behind the body has to be known
# and to make it worse, the target soul can change through the blessing into different state of being
# especially through strong blessings
# so that you loose connection
# and have to reconnect
# so this water changes very quickly while blessing it
# so that you have to constantly reconnect
# to be able to bless it
# after a while or a view trys you may sense the water responding in some way
# like radiating or reflecting your spirit
# and indeed this water radiates its spirit in the same way like you as a person
# so basicly you have created a bottle full of angelique beings 
# or a spirit copy of your blood
# but even better
# it is pure and without all the distortions and all that crap that comes with your blood
# and of course you don't have to kill yourself or waste your blood
# so when the state of being of the water differs much with your state of being
# the effects can be pretty intense
## but you have to bless it with the spirit coming from your soul, from your inner heart
# so whatever you think with your brain 
# or whatever actions you do with your body have no effect
# and keep care that nobody looks at it or hear it, you don't want to influence it


### so let's look a little deeper in blessed water
# as already shown the magnets only remove the distortions in the water
# so that it becomes more responsive for blessings
# and the blessings itself are less distorted also
# and when you drink water you have tended that way
# all its properties become part of your own body environment
# so that your brain renderings of spirit sensations becomes easier and more like cristal clear
# it also increase the flow abilities, it feels more soft and silky
# so that your overall blood flow becomes better also
# and because it is a passive material without complex living beings in it
# you don't have to deal with unwanted influences during the blessing process
# except other people who can influence it
# so you should care for a trusted environment while blessing it
# however, you can not bless with thoughts of your brain
# because your brain is nothing but a rendering engine that usualy grabs all the awareness of your soul
# that's why you believe that your brain and your body is you
# so you have to have experienced some heavenly spirit sensations, which are all without words or images
# but pure understanding
# that you have to render into expressions of words and images on your own, to describe what you have expeeienced
# so pure spirit from heaven or simply holy spirit is pure sensation and understanding without any words, forms or images
# and this spirit is the state of being, you have to move into
# so that it becomes your main awareness
# and take the water with you into your state of being
# as if you are a taxi, that carries a bottle of water through the spirit realms into heaven
## so that's basicly how to bless all living beings based on water
# but you can test your result by drinking your own blessed water
# and when you do so, you literaly climb the mountain step by step into heaven
# as if you have become bigger wings with every stroke that bring you higher into the heavens
# but you should be aware, that the sensation of heaven can become so strong
# that you can't handle it any more and you fall literaly blank on your face 
# because of the overhelming holyness that surrounds you
# and when you ignore this and try to climb even higher
# it begins to become painfull and literaly life threatening
# because the enlightment becomes too bright and turns into sensation of heat
# like an all consuming fire
## so when you get aware that your blessings seems to work
# you can bless every living being in the exact same way
# so this simple device works also like a test dummy to learn to bless things with your soul
# and you can literaly wash yourself clean from all unwanted spirits with it
# and become complete invulnerable against all demonic attacks
# but you can also drive yourself into complete wickedness without the blessings from heaven in it
# and you should be warned, that the more you move into heaven, the more you will get aware how dark this world has become allready
# which is probably the most terrifying experience you will get through this simple device


### but let's look what your created angels can do...
# when you drink your blessed water, the angels in it cast all evil out of you
# and you become complete invulnerable against all matter decivements
# you overall life energy rises up to a level you have last experienced as you was a child
# and when you give it your children prior puberty you have a very good chance that they become heavenly like you
# for children within puberty there is a 50/50 chance to become heavenly like you
# but for all after puberty keep in mind that we don't run for success in heaven
# and respect the free will of others
# and that it is complete impossible to blow the spirit of heaven into the water because of success
# so beware to run for success while trying to bless the spirit of heaven
# because to run for success and become great belongs to the kindom of pride, that is the opposide of heaven or simply hell
# play fg


### The highest heaven is in the same way form- and bodyless than the deepest hell
# even the desperation and the hopelessness is the same
# the only difference is the awareness of everything you allow to be part of you
# and whatever you allow to be part of you, becomes part of your soul
# and your soul grows by becoming rich in diversity
# and with the diversity of your soul grows your awareness
# and with a growing awareness you become more stable
# and with stability comes peace
# and with peace comes comfort
# and with comfort comes forgiveness
# and with forgiveness comes love
# and love reaches out for more diversity to integrate into your soul and grow with it


### so let's go matter and reconnect our bodys with the diversity of nature
# a plant that comes into life, begins very acid to dissolve minerals out of it's environment
# and becomes more and more alcaline over time
# but on humans and animals it is the opposide way
# we begin alcaline and become more and more acid and stiff over time
# and the water becomes distorted as well
# but that's on both the same
# so we are going now to cook an age roll back soup for our skin
# but don't use it for children before or within puberty
# for that we need a heat source
# some nice water - about a half liter
# a filter
# some minerals or healing earth
# some alkaline from this core-soap, curd-soap or often called hard-soap
# that has an alkaline value of 10
# and it makes the soup a little sticky
# so that all the nice ingridients doesn't fall of so quickly
# then we can add a little spoon of baking soda MAX, that is pure alcaline
# and can be washed out from wood ashes easily
# but this powder you should handle with care
# because it can cause an alcali burn that is way worse than an acid burn (lookup for it on internet to learn the dangers of this powder when not used correctly)
## at this point we have created just a mineralized alcaline cream like soap
# and we can put it aside for longer use

# for a high concentrated cream - don't use directly -
# you need 
# 1L hot water, 
# 1piece core soap, 
# 50g baking soda, 
# 100g healing earth
# shake it every hour while cooling down and over the whole day afterwards
# it may get very thing and you will have to add some water to make it thinner

# now add some stinging nessel (very good), some grass and flowers to it
# you can buy as bunny food very cheap and easy

# lavender, camomile for some parfume to it

# you can add sweetwood and moss also

# pinus silvestris or pine needles, you can as oil also, calms down your nerve system
# helps to free from all kind of addictions

# pini sibiricum spruce needles is one of the most fearsome virus killers

# avoid sugar

# eat sour dough


# walk barefoot whenever possible 
# step on loose street gravel to train your feet
# make a little hometrainer with some wet gravel on an old towel or floor cloth
# blisters are caused by sliding or pushing foot moves while walking caused by shortened and stiff muskels, you may have to relearn to walk very sensitive walking and become more bendy
# so avoid stiff and grippy ground first to avoid blisters
# avoid cold that make your feet numb
# and you don't detect damage



### 





Let me try to answer like this:
Heaven is all about humility and caring for everything that surrounds you. So you can not enter heaven because of you. Instead you have to become heaven within yourself, so that two heavens merge together, when you enter heaven.

You can not praise the lord as the churches teaches, because heaven is all about humility. To praise someone belongs to the kingdom of pride, that is hell, therefore it is a demonic attack against heaven when you praise the lord.
You can only humble yourself before the lord (repent).

But who is the Lord?
Just look around you, there is nothing that is not God, even you are a shard of God.
But who is the Lord of all the Shards of God in Heaven? It's the most humble, the most selfless, tue most gentle, the most forgiving, the all loving and he loves even hell, because the darkness of hell is the reason for the light in heaven - vice versa. 

So what the curches teaches is all poop and rubbish in the eyes of the lord from heaven.
To pray on before an idol of terror and torment, a rotting body on two sticks for your own salvation, tell me, what is that?! I have no words for that.
Make sure you are not part of that on the day of the Lord. At least, he will not spit you out, because his spit is too worthy for that. He will piss and poop you out into the kingdom of pride, there you can praise the Lord!

### a soul in a body is like a seed in the earth
# where earth means everything we usualy describe as matter interests and sensations
# and the more earth you put above the seed, the more difficult it becomes for the seed, to break through all the earth into the spirit realm
# but on the other hand the seed needs the separation effects of the earth to come into a self conscious life
# and be able to experience itself as a being that exists and live its very own ways
# but that also means, that there is a risk that the seed get buried too deep into the earth - that is it's body
# and get lost into it
# so that the body or the brain runs completely on its own
# and the soul in it doesn't even know that it is alive
# and experience nothing but darkness and damnation
# and the body, that moves completely on it's own, behaves like an artificial inteligent machine without a heart for others
# So when you now pour water that is blessed with the spirit of heaven into such a body by letting drink it
# it is like a direct injection into the body environment like a regular transfusion of blood
# then there is a chance that this soul experience love the first time in such an intensity
# that it becomes like an unbearable pain that burns like hellfire - what it actualy is
# so this soul will come to life first time
# and with it's life it becomes light of awareness
# and get aware that all it's works was selfish 
# and at the same time you will get in direct touch with all the despair this soul was in
# which can be an unbelievable heartbreaking experience
# so when souls get in direct touch with each other, they feel each other in the same moment
# so there is no one who touches first
# the time delay how this touch comes to surface
# and how this experience is expressed
# is caused only through the body environment
# and the interpretation capabilities of the brain
## so don't expect a welcome greeting as reaction
# the reaction is more like as when you try to lit up wet wood for a campfire
# where you get only breath taking smoke first 
# and when you look into it, your eyes burn in tears
# so whatever comes up then
# depends on how wet the wood, that is the integrity of the soul lays in pride
# and when the soul is too deep wet in pride
# the soul will never lit up and humble itself in repentence
# and it is most likely that you get drawn down breathless in smoke 
# and drown wet in tears
# too pride to let go those who refuse to move into the humility of heaven
# so you can try to lit up the fire of repentence on others by blessing them
# but it may turn out very badly for you
# 



# don't breath it in and don't look into it, just try to ignore and forgive it
# because it is all brainwork
# 

# by the soul that comes to life
# but there is only a 50/50 chance, that this soul moves into repentence
# and humble it selfs
# so what this self humbling souls need the most in that situation
# is forgiveness
# and carefully get explained how things work
# and that there is no reason for judgement at all
# but there is also a chance that such a soul moves even more into hatred and judgement and can not overcome it's pride
# and there is nothing you can do against it
# the free will of every soul is always and most deeply respected in heaven
# so when this soul decides to become a great and famous demon lord in the kingdom of pride, we from heaven have to respect this and let them go




## but you can not bless with your thoughts of your brain
# you have to have at least a little light of heaven within your soul to bless it with it
# otherwise you only open the door to all kind of spirit influences you can imagine
# and because this world is currently in a very strong ruling striving
# this will be the blessing then
# that is a blessing of cristal clear hatred, judgement and wickedness
#

3. opportunity
# make you water

### 4. opportunity
# humble your self down until you reached desperation
# and when you have reached desperation
# let your hopelessness describe what you are praying for
# and you can be sure that help is on the way
# but keep in mind that this world is pretty dense
# and it can take a while to organize something that serves your needs
# so avoid pride
# because it hinders you to humble yourself
# and you become unable to pray
# that's why demons never pray
# so as long as you are able to humble yourself down to desperation
# for you the door to heaven stays allways open


### 
# ... so ...
# show fg


### ... but ...
# best wine for the last
# there are some places I like to go
# so when you think you are ready
# you are heartly invited
# but don't ask me when
# because it is completely on you
# and when don't know what color you should
# there is only one color that fits to heaven
# and it's name is
# genuine


When a selfish looks into a mirror, he see only himself,
whereas an unselfish see only his surroundings


To reach the deepest
you have to jump from the highest

-- vice versa --


It doesn't matter how many healthy apples you put around a rotting one,
it's just a matter of time until the rotting smell reach the surface

-- vice versa --


# 
# so you should expect some delay



### let's examine the old and the new tree of life
# 



### so what are your bodys good for then?
# your body help you to discover new states of beings and grow in beauty of diversity that way


# keep holy heaven within and strive for it in hell conditions
# is in the same way difficult like 
# keeping holy heaven and strive for it in heavenly conditions

## so here you can become the keepholder of heaven


####################

### 

# who is the king of heaven of love
# where all the nice expressions of life standing around
# so the heaven of love is the lower heaven of comfort
# or the expression of the most high heaven of forgivenesss
# where is nothing any more but peace
## and on the opposide
# there is the lower hell of hatred
# where all the terrifying expressions of death standing around##
# that is an expression of the most deep hell of judgement
# so on the very outside between judgement and forgiveness
# is the source of life or death
# and even there is a king of the most high heaven of forgiveness
# that is me, "michael" the great prince
# but I am also the most high king of hell of judgement
# in the same way as the king of heaven of love is also the king of hell of hatred
# and you may wonder how that can be
# but when you look a bit deeper
# then you will have to admit
# that nobody ever caused so much hatred than this guy
# but this happens when you focus too much in love
# and forget to let go with forgiveness
# then you will end up like this love-guy in hatred
# and move more and more into the expressions of love
# and need an opportunity to move back through forgiveness
# or the other hand
# when you focus too much on forgiveness
# or you end up like me 
# and move more and more into judgement
# and need an opportunity as well to move back through forgiveness
# so you will have to keep love and forgiveness in balance even in heaven to stay there
# in the same way
# as you will have to keep hatred and judgement in balance even in hell to stay there


### let's look into the center




# and in the center
# where the striving is the strongest
# everything melts together
# into infinite despair and hopelessness
# that is the king of kings



### let's examine the difference between love and forgiveness
# when you love, you give something to another one or just spend some comfort and don't want anything in return
# so that no binding relationship is created and both can continue to move freely
# but forgiveness is more complex
# so you forgive, when someone has something taken away from you or just hurt you 
# and you don't want to do anything in return
# but you forgive also, when someone had something given to you or just comforted you
# and you don't want to do anything in return
# so without a deep understanding of both sides of forgiveness you can't even receive the pleasures of heaven
# but when you understood this, heaven appears to be very ignorant
# but that is all about peace, to not care
# so love can give you comfort by being active in caring, but only forgiveness can give you peace by releasing from everything
# therefore love and forgiveness are basicly the greatest enemys in heaven
# but even then, they can not exist without each other
# because without some contradicting forces there would never anything happen
# so there are even in heaven contradicting forces you will have to live with
# but when you move too far into one of this forces, you easily move into the other striving
# so when you focus to much into forgiveness and love begins to remind you to love
# you can move into love or into judgement by judging love to care too much
# and on the other hand, when you move too much into love and forgiveness reminds you to calm down
# you can calm down or move into hatred because of the ignorance of forgiveness
# so there is no place where you are fully save
# however, the amount of savety increases with the amount of your awareness and the awareness of your environment
# and because everyone in heaven is very aware what is going on,
# and understand the meaning of love and forgiveness
# it is pretty difficult to fall out of heaven


### let's look how the main spirit skydirections  relates to each other
# we start a forgiveness amd go around clockwise into love, hatred and forgiveness
# but let us start at forgiveness and go counter-clockwise by moving into the heavenly dream-state
# by moving into forgiveness, we move into the light of general awareness, without taking action
# so basicly, in our heavenly dream-state we dissolve like a drop of water in the ocean
# and because our awareness expands limitless, we will come across something we want to interact with
# so basicly, we come across something we judge, because we are not pleased with it
# and when this happens, we awake and move into loving actions
# and in hell it works very similar
# by moving into judgement, we move into darkness of general repelling everything to find peace
# so basicly, in our hellish dream-state we become like a dead stone
# and because we can not really isolate ourself from our environment, something will sooner or later interact with us
# and when this happens, we awake and move into hating actions


### let's look what this guy basicly did
# he moved from the heavenly dream-state into love
# but instead of releasing with forgiveness he move into the matter-area
# where the strivings clushes together
# there he send his message
# but to return to heaven he needed an opportunity to move counter-clockwise into forgiveness
# so choosed a very quick and rediciulus hard  way 
# by causing trouble against the ruling leaders
# to get most badly beaten up
# and never move into hatred or judgement while this happend
# but as said, it doesn't have to be that hard
# and just punishing you body is very ineffective and risky
# because you can die before you reach your target
# the other way is through psychic terror and forgive everything no matter what
# that was my way
# but even this way is not without risk
# because you can kill yourself before reaching your target


### so let's look into the coming spiritual warefare and what is to come
# basicly this is up to you
# or in other words
# in the same way what blessed water causes in a human body
# human body causes on earth
# for this I have prepared a spirit world thing to explain this
# look, here we have the servant heaven side
# and here the ruling hell side
# imagine this more like a ball for a better understanding
# and the border is the lower striving area
# so basicly the matter reality
# and in the near future, with the next major development of matter life
# the connection between the strivings completely breaks
# imagine to cut this in two with a knife or scissors
# but because both strivings can not exist without each other
# another connection or a spirit tunnel from the most high mountain of heaven
# down to the most deep pit of hell has been established allready
# so once the old connection through matter breaks
# and you can't move to heaven any more by becoming a heavenly being through matter life
# you will have to reach this dark spot of infinite despair and hopelessness to move to heaven
# but to reach it, everything that does not belong to heaven has to be destroyed within you
# every hope to get proud and sucessful has to be completely destroyed
# otherwise you can not switch into the servant heavens
# so the door to heaven through learning love and forgiveness has been shut down
# and you have to go through the other door
# by becoming a complete desperate and hopeless failure within your ruling environment
# and then
# one of my angels will come and pick you up to become a member of heaven
# all will be forgiven
# you will be covered in everlasting love
# but even if your freedom will be limitless
# your own free will will be reduced to what was left within you that belonged to heaven
# you can get destroyed down to a drop of water and below
# so your blood is in my hands then
# but that is not what I want
# I want fully free beings around me
# who can stand my spirit presence as if it is nothing special


### is there a chance to keep the eath and free the earth from all evil?
# yes, there is
# but the risk, that all this mess repeats -- stays
# and you have to understand, that you can not reach this with hatred and judgement
# instead there will be needed plenty of endurance and forgiveness and yet some love
# so when you want to give it a try
# I can perhaps help you on that
# but you have to understand that I have to follow the rules of heaven
# and can't just do something you probably don't want
# so I have to ask you to for permission provide some help and protection
# to lit up your little campfire in your house again


### so when you think this is something needfull
# there is a forbidden place I like to go - sometimes
# a last bedtime story in my mind
# and some deeper knowledge if you like
# perhaps you want to hear it with some nice cool drinks, dressed up with some angels
# but you have to understand, that I can not accept to get prised, applauded
# I can not serve expectations, because they only outputs of your brain-TV
# and I can not accept too much comfort
# just that much that I can survive it and stay halfaway healthy, that would be nice
# otherwise I have to shut down and you get nothing from me
# and when I get aware you move into pride, hatred or judgement becausevof me
# I have to shut down also
# so you have to be at least humble or you get nothing from me
