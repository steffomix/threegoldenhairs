# ok, let's go into the real thing and rebuild heaven
# and because we can find heaven only within us
# we are going to build a temple like building that looks like a soul from heaven
# and while we are doing this we become a deeper understanding
# why it is so difficult to cross over the strivings


### finish building simple device


### let's look at my shepherd staff to get a starting point
# there are 3 days and 7 seals
# so we draw a seven edged area
# and this area is the first day of our childhood
# and call it 7 mountains of love
# and the way how you place your goods - that are yoir life experiences - into this area builds up your striving
# so you can be obedient against rulers, that are your parents in the first place
# to build mostly servant life experiences
# or you can rule or just be disobedient against others, that are your parents in the first place
# to build most likely ruling life experiences
# so basicly you can not build servants without rulers and rulers without servants
# because in our bodys we behave like free moving magnets
# where rulers attract servants and servants attract rulers
# but in spirit we are like a part of one big magnet
# so when we now look into the book of life
# then we see that we need an intersection of the states of being
# to come together
# and thats how families are connected with their future childrens
# so you see, that when a huge community draws down more and more into the darkness
# the chance of heavenly souls reduces because lack of intersections in the states of beings
# so that dark souls barely will bring light souls to birth
# however, when the parents are strong rulers, there is at least a chance
# that the children become servants through them
# so that the earth has some kind of self balancing abilities


### however, when you are a ruling soul, your overall development ends in the childhood
# because of your inner emptyness you strive to the very outside
# and your ruling nature is the way you protect yourself
# to rule over everything outside and become great and successfull
# and punish everything that dares to touch you
# to become a sensation of security due to your greatness


### but when you belong to the servant striving, you will try to find security within yourself
# and develop an most inner holy place where you feel secure amd confident
# and seal it with the most gentle, loving and all forgiving seals you can ever create
# as a barrier to become unbreakable from within
# but to do so, you have to sacrifice some space of your outside beauty
# to have a place where your soul will live and defines it's meaning of life
# and this happens usually during your puberty


### so let's draw another 7 edged area into the allready defined area
# that is our second day of puberty
# because during this time of puberty we get literaly nailed into our dressed up body 
# and we have to deal with it
# so when you - as part of the childrens environment - have managed to dress up a servant body for a ruling soul 
# you will be pretty surprised what a troublemaker you have all of a sudden
# but when you have managed to build up a ruling body for a servant soul
# you will have someone who most likely jump from the bridge to get rid of this unbearable thing


### so in the second day you basicly define your meaning of life
# that's the way you want to live
# and because this can only happen to servant souls
# we can call this hallway of ark angels
# where ark stands for unbreakable
# and this hallway works like a last frontier medium to your most inner holy place
# whereas ruling souls never build up an inner place
# they always stay like continous fighting and most likely stupid predator animals


### but to discover the third day, that is our most holy place
# we have to face a terrifying environment in an unbreakable servant way
# and get literaly pressed backwards into the state of being from where we all come from
# that is death
# that is infinite despair and hopelessness
# that is the state of being before all creation
# and only in this state of death we can find the source of life within us
# because we go through the same process like all creation
# and become the most deep understanding of love and forgiveness
# because only when you have experienced to get lost in the nothingness
# you know the worthy of everything, no matter what it is
# and then your most inner temple crushes into peaces
# and your sealed doors multiply to blast out streams of unbreakable love that purifies evetything in its way
# and streams of tears of unbreakable forgiveness breaks through everything no matter what it is
# because everything is made out of Gods tears of forgiveness
# that's where all the water comes from


### so when you now look at this construction
# it looks a bit like a blossom
# with the petals of your childhood that expresses your life experiences
# the anthers as your holy seals that describes our ystriving based on your life experiences
# and the ovary as your most holy place in where you discover your oneness with all everything
# so that only one who has the same signature as you can enter it
# to create together the ovule, that contains the morning star with the holy spirit of heaven
# and the reason why there is all mirrors is because you see in everything nothing but expressions of yourself
# so whatever you do to others, you do to yourself
# and it becomes impossible for you to not love or forgive


### so let's make an overview how it looks like right now
# there are 7 petals and 3 circles
# the outer heaven as the 7 mountains of love
# the inner heaven as the hallway of the ark angels
# and the most inner holy place as the throne room
# now we make 7 doors and hallways through all 3 circles
# like a beams of light of purity
# and in the doors to the most inner holy place we put the seals
# lying on the ground


### and the seals we make like that:
# one outer layer of thick and cleaned glass
# with the first day transparent engraved into it
# so that you can barely see, but feel it from the outside
# underneath the second day
# engraved in thick glass 
# and filled with white color of undiscovered wisdom of heaven
# and underneath of it a mirror out of thick glass
# with the third day engraved from behind through the reflecting layer of the mirror
# and instead of the seven mirrors on my shepherd staff
# the witness of the second day shall choose a name once and forever
# and around all the glass and mirrors put 4 mirrors with 12 holes 
# and put 12 lights behind them to shine into the seals
# and make a frame out of brass of hope of forgiveness 
# with 12  7-edged stars out of red glass around it
# where the light shines through the outside
# and screw front and back together with 4 big screws on each edge
# gentle round from the upside as the four cardinal directions of heaven
# where peace and comfort pave your way to discover all faces of love and forgiveness
# but ruff and nasty from the bottom side as the buried four faces of hell
# where performance and competition pave your way to discover all faces of hatred and judgement
# and make 7 screws on the top and bottom of medium size
# gentle round from the upside  as the 7 seals of heaven
# but ruff and nasty from the bottom side as the 7 seals of hell
# and make 10 little screws at the left and right
# gentle round as the 10 commandments of your childhood
# but ruff and nasty as the 10 commandments of childhood
# and put the seals in that direction on the ground
# that you have to go down on your knees 
# and look in a servant caring way from the inside to the outside
# to be able to read them
# and on the backside engrave a big cross
# and fill it with silver of purity


### and the morning star make like a tear drop of love and forgiveness falling down from heaven
# for that make it like my shepherd staff, but cut of the first day
# and replace it with a chain, made out of gold of forgiveness
# and instead of wood, make a conic hose out of silver of purity
# and hammer in the seven mirrors of awareness
# fill the conic hose with ashes of humility and hammer it in so that it don't fall of from alone
# then write the second and third day with leaf gold of forgiveness on it like a gentle touch
# and polish it all to perfect brilliance
# then mold cleaned glass of Gods tears and mix in some dust of diamonds of angels from heaven
# and pour it over the staff 
# and let it hang down from the center top of the center dome 
# with chain out of gold of forgiveness as the first day
# the second in the middle
# and the third day at the bottom
# so when you can't take it anymore and your forgiveness breaks
# a humble tear drop of pure love, filled with gold of forgiveness is raining from the sky
# to give you consolation and comfort and remind you to not throw away the holy spirit of heaven 


### now take water from a deep well underneath the center dome
# and let it run through the simple device several times underneath the floor of the center dome
# to clean it from all distress
# and lit it run into a little shell like pond in the center
# from where it runs through the broken mirrors, through a little holes in the corners of the walls
# through the gardens of heaven
# and call them seven rivers of forgiveness
# and all the water that is not used, let run outside and let it sink back to where it comes from
# to bless the earth with the spirit from heaven


### so lets draw a sketch of all this and add a shields against magnetic influences
# there is the center dome with the mold, filled with purified water
# and the simple devices underneath to free the water from all distress
# the morning star, the flame of the holy spirit of heaven hanging down from the center top
# and floating over the water
# and break the walls up to the roof 10 times to forgive the 10 commandments
# which are needed only during childhood of the first day
# afterwards go like this:
# when the environment has become so bad, that someone needs to steal for whatever reason, who is the thief?
# then we have the seven doors with the seals that are broken out of the walls from inside out
# and lying half in the doors and half in the hallways of the ark angels
# then we have the 7 mountains of love as the body of heaven 
# with everything that is good and healthy in several rings
# and underneath of all that are running invisible the seven rivers of forgiveness
# with a liitle well in each ring of each mountain of love
# so that the more high the mountains of love are, the more deep you have to dig to find the never ending rivers of forgiveness
# and there are the 7 lightbeams of purity with the entrys to heaven at the end
# and an image from the outside with the two witnesses
# blowing hand in hand the trumpets of love and forgiveness
# and the sun of men as the source of love in the center
# the blue sky of everlasting forgiveness
# and the green grass of living comfort of heaven at the bottom


### now shield the dome with a faradaic cage all around
# and shield the hallway of the ark angels  a  2. times with another faradaic cage all around
# and shield all  a 3. times with a faradaic cage all around
# and the whole building has no doors you can close
# except the 7 entrys to the very ouside
# so keep the entrys between the days as small as possible to not destroy the shields


### so, this building is the representation of a soul from heaven
# and it describes how difficult it is to change your striving into its opposide
# you literally have to destroy everything that defines you as who you are
# so when I give a hellish soul water that is blessed with the spirit from heaven
# it causes unbearable pain
# because it destroys everything what you are living for
# all your good life experiences become  bad
# and all your bad life experiences become good
# so you most likely can not drink it
# or it tastes terrifying
# so changing your striving means the complete destruction of your soul
# down to your bare naked sensation of existence
# means death of yourself, by going through second death
# of infinite despair and hopelessness
# and get reborn as a new soul and begin from start
# but don't understand this as a matter switch
# it is a spiritual switch
# and to be able to switch you have to understand to where you have to switch to
# so you have to understand how things work in heaven
# to be able to switch into it it


# so let's look how the command hirarchy works in heaven
# well, in heaven we do not command
# in heaven we provide opportunities
# but the responsibility of the given opportunity stays on the provider
# so that the one who become and grab an opportunity can grow in love
# and don't have to fear any consequences if he fails
# but if he fails, the provider can grow in forgiveness first
# and in love aftereards by executing the opportunity by himself
# so you should not provide opportunities, you can not handle by yourself
# or fix the damage that the one caused who has become the opportunity you provided
# so when you become and execute an opportunity from heaven
# but forward it to another one
# the responsibility stays on you
# therefore all in heaven is given by grace
# because he who gives it, see the potential in you to make it
# and when you make it, you can make it fully free, without any restrictions or limitations
# the only limitation you have is your potential
# and of course you can ask your provider for guidance
# but you can not expect it
# because expectations are nothing more than the result of predictions of your brain
# so whatever you expect from spirit, will never be served
# because in spirit we can walk only by trust, there is no prediction possible
# the only thing you can do is to pray by moving into desperation
# and let you hopelessness describe what you are praying for
# therefore no desperation and no hopelessness -- no help
# sounds hard, but desperation and hopelessness are just a states of being like any other
# and once you learned to move into them, it isn't that hard anymore as it sounds in the first place
# this is because in heaven we walk by trust


### so I have 2 opportunities to give away
# the first is for the witness of love we have seen at the end of the second day
# to make you a morning star of any size you like
# but instead of glass you can use resin or some layers of paint color with a little glitter effect
# and you can use charcole instead of ashes, because it's easier to handle
# and you can use aluminium instead of silver and it doesn't even have to be conic
# and instead of gold leaf you can use a goldish looking pen
# then make sheath and a belt to wield your morning star like a sword
# but never punish stonehearted with it to make them repent in tears
# this sword is a guidance for you and for everyone who want to look at it
# but never force someone to do so or wield it too openly to be end up as sharkfood or make mockers worse
# so make a sheath you can only partially look through
# you need this guidance, because you have the potential to watch over 7 mountains, the body of heaven
# but don't reach out on your own for someone to help you
# just sit and wait until someone comes to you
# if nobody comes, enjoy your free time
# and if someone want to build it without you, let them try 
# and when they struggle, help them only when they are all laying down in despair and hopelessness
# but if someone please you humble for guidance, and you don't know how it should look in detail
# just let 7 mountains look like a christmas tree full of presents from heaven


### the second opportunity goes to the second witness of forgiveness
# we have seen at the third day
# to make you another morning star just like the first witness of love
# and I want you to watch over the center dome, 7 rivers, 7 beams of light, the 7 entrys of heaven and the 7 seals, the wells in the mountains of love and the shields
# so basically everything that does not belong to 7 mountains of love
# but you will have to respect, how much room the first witness of love is willing to give you
# so if the love decides to make it all alone, enjoy your free time
# but if love gives you room
# let the first witness of love decide the name in the  3. layer of the 7 seals in the 2. day
# that will replace the 7 mirrors of the morning star because there is allready all mirror in the 3. layer of the seals
# and when love decides to overgrow your forgiveness as something useless
# let love try and it struggles, don't help until all is lying down in despair an hopelessness


### let's figure out where to build all this
# all matter reality is an expression of the meaning of spirit life
# but when you focus too much on the expressions of the meaning
# you easily bury the meaning underneath the expression
# and get lost in a meaningless life
# so you can indeed build all this anywhere and even in multiple ways in the world
# but when you loose track of it's meaning, you all get buried underneath it's meaningless expressions
# and die the second death where you find your self in infinite darkness
# with far distant memories of heaven in your heart, causing unbearable pain, despair and hopelessness
# so the most favorite place where you should build all this is within yourself
# and only then, when it has become a solid ground within yourself
# and has been proofed to stand all storms
# so that this building and you has become unbreakable one
# then you can build it as a memento of your conquest


### let's create some angels
# and populate them into our just conquered earth
# to cast out all the allready defeated evil nature from here
# but don't be fooled when this water begins to seem useless
# because then you are just in line with it
# use simple device ...
# the flame of the holy spirit of heaven floating over the waters
# that is the fire, that has to burn in your heart
# that is the fire of repentence you have to lit up in your most holy fireplace
# to be a light in heaven
# to be able to create angels



### let's examine the difference between love and forgiveness
# when you love, you give something to another one or just spend some comfort and don't want anything in return
# so that no binding relationship is created and both can continue to move fully free
# but forgiveness is more complex
# so you forgive, when someone has something taken away from you or just hurt you and you don't want to do anything in return
# but you forgive also, when someone had something given to you or just comforted you don't want to do anything in return
# so when you can not receive pleasures without the need to thank for it in any way, you have not fully learned the meaning of forgiveness
# but the fully understanding of love and forgiveness is required to discover heavenly peace within yourself in full quality
# so love and both sides of forgiveness looks alltogether pretty much like ignorance
# and when you no look a little step further, you see that the infinite peace on the most high mountain of heaven is the same as the most deep point of damnation in infinite darkness
# both means death


### but let's go deeper into love and forgiveness
# the more you walk from the darkness into the light
# so the more light you become, the dark appears everything around you
# but when you become the light itself, everything becomes darkness for you
# so to become the light itself 
# you have to love and forgive all everything
# even if there is nothing but darkness
# everything sucks up all life out of you
# everything abuses you
# and you can't even move
# there is nothing but depression and wickedness around you 
# and breaks your heart on and on
# only to discover that the point of view of the source of life itself 
# is the most terrifying place imaginable
# and you can only stand on this place 
# when your love and forgiveness has become infinite desperate and hopelessness













### so there are some who have been touched allready by the spirit of heaven
# directly through spirit realm
# that may have been the king of heaven or even me
# and you will know this without a doubt
# and if this happened, you will be able to bless water with the spirit of heaven for sure
# but you should bless youself with it for a couple of days to become a stronger and more stable connection
# so that you can help others
# but you should help children first
# because you will get in direct spirit contact with those you help and everything evil that goes along them
# to give them strength and help them fight their fight against all evil in them
# and children are the most easiest to handle
# evil natures in children may be very violent but have most likely low endurance
# however, be carefull and don't overtax yourself
