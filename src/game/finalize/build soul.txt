# what you just have seen you can not grasp without some purification
# into a heavenly striving
# because your body is most likely messed up in both directions
# and cause  plenty of distortions
# just as if your innier mirrors are dirty and suck up the light
# and when too much light hits all this distortions
# it feels like heavy heat, and can cause insane spirit pain
# and then - you run away or fall blank on your face
# therefore let us finish this simple device
# so that you can prepare yourself for what is coming upon you now
# because we are going into wisdom of divine majority now,
# build a soul from heaven and explain a little deeper how all that works 


### finish building simple device 


### let's look at my shepherd staff you have seen at the very beginning mjto get a starting point
# there are 3 days and 7 seals
# so we draw a seven edged area
# and this area is the first day of our childhood
# and call it 7 mountains of love
# and the way how you place your goods - that are yoir life experiences - into this area builds up your striving
# so you can be obedient against rulers, that are your parents in the first place
# to build mostly servant life experiences
# or you can rule or just be disobedient against others, that are your parents in the first place
# to build most likely ruling life experiences
# so basicly you can not build servants without rulers and rulers without servants
# because in our bodys we behave like free moving magnets
# where rulers attract servants and servants attract rulers
# but in spirit we are like a part of one big magnet
# so when we now look into the book of life
# then we see that we need an intersection of the states of being
# to come together
# and thats how families are connected with their future childrens
# so you see, that when a huge community draws down more and more into the darkness
# the chance of heavenly souls reduces because lack of intersections in the states of beings
# so that dark souls barely will bring light souls to birth
# however, when the parents are strong rulers, there is at least a chance
# that the children become servants through them
# so that the earth has some kind of self balancing abilities


### however, when you are a ruling soul, your overall development ends in the childhood
# and  because of your inner emptyness you strive to the very outside
# your ruling nature is the way to protect yourself
# to rule over everything outside 
# and become your security through your fearsome greatness
# you punish or most likely let punish everything that dares to touch you
# and to become a sensation of security that way


### but when you belong to the servant striving, you will try to find security within yourself
# and begin to develop an most inner holy place where you feel secure amd confident
# and seal it with the most gentle, loving and all forgiving seals you can ever create
# as a barrier to become unbreakable from within
# but to do so, you have to sacrifice some space of your outside beauty
# to have a place where your soul will live and defines it's meaning of life
# and this happens usually during your puberty


### so let's draw another 7 edged area into the allready defined area
# that is our second day of puberty
# because during this time of puberty you finally move into your dressed up body 
# and have to deal with it
# wheras a ruling soul always stays aside, like not really there
# so that there never a development of the soul takes place
# so when you - as part of the childrens environment - have managed to dress up a servant body for a ruling soul 
# you will be pretty surprised what a troublemaker you have all of a sudden
# but when you have managed to build up a ruling body for a servant soul
# you will have someone who most likely jump from the bridge to get rid of this unbearable thing


### so in the second day you basicly define your seals who protect your most inner holy place
# that's the way you want to live
# and because - this can only happen to servant souls
# and we want to build a real strong soul
# we can call this area hallway of ark angels
# where ark stands for unbreakable
# "hallway" because it is an area that protects your holy place 
# from everything that does not match the seals
# so this hallway works like a last frontier, that mediates to your most inner holy place


### but to discover the third day, that is our most holy place
# is not so easy
# because it is the place where we are connected directly with the source of life
# and it may sound strange
# but the source where we all come from is death
# so we have to face a terrifying environment
# and stay unbreakable servant
# to get literaly pressed backwards into the state of being 
# from where we all come from a second time
# that is second death
# and spirit death is infinite despair and hopelessness
# that is the state of being before all creation
# and only in this state of death we can find the source of life within us
# where we look into the mirror of ourself without anything in between
# that way we discover the process of all creation
# and become the most deep understanding of love and forgiveness
# because only when you have experienced to get lost in the nothingness
# you know the worthy of everything, no matter what it is
# and finally discover 
# that everything is made out of Gods tears of forgiveness
# that's where all the water comes from
# and then everything 
# so let's draw the holy place behind the seals

### so when you now look at this construction
# it looks a bit like a blossom
# with the petals of your childhood that expresses your life experiences
# the anthers as your holy seals that describes our ystriving based on your life experiences
# and the ovary as your most holy place in where you discover your oneness with all everything
# so that only one who has the same signature as you can enter it
# to create together the ovule, that contains the morning star with the holy spirit of heaven
# and the reason why there is all mirrors is because you see in everything nothing but expressions of yourself
# so whatever you do to others, you do to yourself
# and it becomes impossible for you to not love or forgive


### so let's make an overview how it looks like right now
# there are 7 petals and 3 circles
# the outer heaven as the 7 mountains of love
# the inner heaven as the hallway of the ark angels
# and the most inner holy place as the throne room
# now we make 7 doors and hallways through all 3 circles
# like a beams of light of purity
# and in the doors to the most inner holy place we put the seals
# lying on the ground


### and the seals we make like that:
# one outer layer of thick and cleaned glass
# with the first day transparent engraved into it
# so that you can barely see, but feel it from the outside
# underneath the second day
# engraved in thick glass 
# and filled with white color of undiscovered wisdom of heaven
# and underneath of it a mirror out of thick glass
# with the third day engraved from behind through the reflecting layer of the mirror
# and instead of the seven mirrors on my shepherd staff
# the witness of the second day shall choose a name once and forever
# and around all the glass and mirrors put 4 mirrors with 12 holes 
# and put 12 lights behind them to shine into the seals
# and make a frame out of brass of hope of forgiveness 
# with 12  7-edged stars out of red glass around it
# where the light shines through the outside
# and screw front and back together with 4 big screws on each edge
# gentle round from the upside as the four cardinal directions of heaven
# where peace and comfort pave your way to discover all faces of love and forgiveness
# but ruff and nasty from the bottom side as the buried four faces of hell
# where performance and competition pave your way to discover all faces of hatred and judgement
# and make 7 screws on the top and bottom of medium size
# gentle round from the upside  as the 7 seals of heaven
# but ruff and nasty from the bottom side as the 7 seals of hell
# and make 10 little screws at the left and right
# gentle round as the 10 commandments of your childhood
# but ruff and nasty as the 10 commandments of childhood
# and put the seals in that direction on the ground
# that you have to go down on your knees 
# and look in a servant caring way from the inside to the outside
# to be able to read them
# and on the backside engrave a big cross
# and fill it with silver of purity


### and the morning star make like a tear drop of love and forgiveness falling down from heaven
# for that make it like my shepherd staff, but cut of the first day
# and replace it with a chain, made out of gold of forgiveness
# and instead of wood, make a conic hose out of silver of purity
# and hammer in the seven mirrors of awareness
# fill the conic hose with ashes of humility and hammer it in so that it don't fall of from alone
# then write the second and third day with leaf gold of forgiveness on it like a gentle touch
# and polish it all to perfect brilliance
# then mold cleaned glass of Gods tears and mix in some dust of diamonds of angels from heaven
# and pour it over the staff 
# and let it hang down from the center top of the center dome 
# with chain out of gold of forgiveness as the first day
# the second in the middle
# and the third day at the bottom
# so when you can't take it anymore and your forgiveness breaks
# a humble tear drop of pure love, filled with gold of forgiveness is raining from the sky
# to give you consolation and comfort and remind you to not throw away the holy spirit of heaven 


### now take water from a deep well underneath the center dome
# and let it run through the simple device several times underneath the floor of the center dome
# to clean it from all distress
# and lit it run into a little shell like pond in the center
# from where it runs through the broken mirrors, through a little holes in the corners of the walls
# through the gardens of heaven
# and call them seven rivers of forgiveness
# and all the water that is not used, let run outside and let it sink back to where it comes from
# to bless the earth with the spirit from heaven


### so lets draw a sketch of all this and add a shields against magnetic influences
# there is the center dome with the mold, filled with purified water
# and the simple devices underneath to free the water from all distress
# the morning star, the flame of the holy spirit of heaven hanging down from the center top
# and floating over the water
# and break the walls up to the roof 10 times to forgive the 10 commandments
# which are needed only during childhood of the first day
# afterwards go like this:
# when the environment has become so bad, that someone needs to steal for whatever reason, who is the thief?
# then we have the seven doors with the seals that are broken out of the walls from inside out
# and lying half in the doors and half in the hallways of the ark angels
# then we have the 7 mountains of love as the body of heaven 
# with everything that is good and healthy in several rings
# and underneath of all that are running invisible the seven rivers of forgiveness
# with a liitle well in each ring of each mountain of love
# so that the more high the mountains of love are, the more deep you have to dig to find the never ending rivers of forgiveness
# and there are the 7 lightbeams of purity with the entrys to heaven at the end
# and an image from the outside with the two witnesses
# blowing hand in hand the trumpets of love and forgiveness
# and the sun of men as the source of love in the center
# the blue sky of everlasting forgiveness
# and the green grass of living comfort of heaven at the bottom


### now shield the dome with a faradaic cage all around
# and shield the hallway of the ark angels  a  2. times with another faradaic cage all around
# and shield all  a 3. times with a faradaic cage all around
# and the whole building has no doors you can close
# except the 7 entrys to the very ouside
# so keep the entrys between the days as small as possible to not destroy the shields


### so, this building is the representation of a soul from heaven
# and it describes how difficult it is to change your striving into its opposide
# you literally have to destroy everything that defines you as who you are
# so when I give a hellish soul water that is blessed with the spirit from heaven
# it causes unbearable pain
# because it destroys everything what you are living for
# all your good life experiences become  bad
# and all your bad life experiences become good
# so you most likely can not drink it
# or it tastes terrifying
# so changing your striving means the complete destruction of your soul
# down to your bare naked sensation of existence
# means death of yourself, by going through second death
# of infinite despair and hopelessness
# and get reborn as a new soul and begin from start
# but don't understand this as a matter switch
# it is a spiritual switch
# and to be able to switch you have to understand to where you have to switch to
# so you have to understand how things work in heaven
# to be able to switch into it it


# so let's look how the command hirarchy works in heaven
# well, in heaven we do not command
# in heaven we provide opportunities
# but the responsibility of the given opportunity stays on the provider
# so that the one who become and grab an opportunity can grow in love
# and don't have to fear any consequences if he fails
# but if he fails, the provider can grow in forgiveness first
# and in love aftereards by executing the opportunity by himself
# so you should not provide opportunities, you can not handle by yourself
# or fix the damage that the one caused who has become the opportunity you provided
# so when you become and execute an opportunity from heaven
# but forward it to another one
# the responsibility stays on you
# therefore all in heaven is given by grace
# because he who gives it, see the potential in you to make it
# and when you make it, you can make it fully free, without any restrictions or limitations
# the only limitation you have is your potential
# and of course you can ask your provider for guidance
# but you can not expect it
# because expectations are nothing more than the result of predictions of your brain
# so whatever you expect from spirit, will never be served
# because in spirit we can walk only by trust, there is no prediction possible
# the only thing you can do is to pray by moving into desperation
# and let you hopelessness describe what you are praying for
# therefore no desperation and no hopelessness -- no help
# sounds hard, but desperation and hopelessness are just a states of being like any other
# and once you learned to move into them, it isn't that hard anymore as it sounds in the first place
# this is because in heaven we walk by trust


### so I have 2 opportunities to give away
# the first is for the witness of love we have seen at the end of the second day
# to make you a morning star of any size you like
# but instead of glass you can use resin or some layers of paint color with a little glitter effect
# and you can use charcole instead of ashes, because it's easier to handle
# and you can use aluminium instead of silver and it doesn't even have to be conic
# and instead of gold leaf you can use a goldish looking pen
# then make sheath and a belt to wield your morning star like a sword
# but never punish stonehearted with it to make them repent in tears
# this sword is a guidance for you and for everyone who want to look at it
# but never force someone to do so or wield it too openly to be end up as sharkfood or make mockers worse
# so make a sheath you can only partially look through
# you need this guidance, because you have the potential to watch over 7 mountains, the body of heaven
# but don't reach out on your own for someone to help you
# just sit and wait until someone comes to you
# if nobody comes, enjoy your free time
# and if someone want to build it without you, let them try 
# and when they struggle, help them only when they are all laying down in despair and hopelessness
# but if someone please you humble for guidance, and you don't know how it should look in detail
# just let 7 mountains look like a christmas tree full of presents from heaven


### the second opportunity goes to the second witness of forgiveness
# we have seen at the third day
# to make you another morning star just like the first witness of love
# and I want you to watch over the center dome, 7 rivers, 7 beams of light, the 7 entrys of heaven and the 7 seals, the wells in the mountains of love and the shields
# so basically everything that does not belong to 7 mountains of love
# but you will have to respect, how much room the first witness of love is willing to give you
# so if the love decides to make it all alone, enjoy your free time
# but if love gives you room
# let the first witness of love decide the name in the  3. layer of the 7 seals in the 2. day
# that will replace the 7 mirrors of the morning star because there is allready all mirror in the 3. layer of the seals
# and when love decides to overgrow your forgiveness as something useless
# let love try and when it struggles, don't help until all is lying down in despair an hopelessness


### but for all
# even if the morning star is the most fearsome deamon-slayer imaginable
# it is not it's purpose
# it's a staff of guidance
# that become it's power by going in line with it
# but every time you use it spiritually to cast out deamons
# you move into some hatred, leave it's alignment
# and the morning star becomes literaly dull, dark and useless
# don't punish stone-heated people with it to force them into tears of repentence
# this is not a staff of judgement
# I am the only one who has authority for judgement
# because I am the only one who can catch the consequences
# that's why my staff is written with my very own fire of repentence
# I had to go through to recover from second death
# and believe me, that's something you never ever want to experience in your life


### let's figure out where to build all this
# all matter reality is an expression of the meaning of spirit life
# but when you focus too much on the expressions of the meaning
# you easily bury the meaning underneath the expression
# and get lost in a meaningless life
# so you can indeed build all this anywhere and even in multiple ways in the world
# but when you loose track of it's meaning, you all get buried underneath it's meaningless expressions
# and die the second death where you find your self in infinite darkness
# with far distant memories of heaven in your heart, causing unbearable pain, despair and hopelessness
# so the most favorite place where you should build all this is within yourself
# and only then, when it has become a solid ground within yourself
# and has been proofed to stand all storms
# so that this building and you has become unbreakable one
# then you can build it as a memento of your conquest


### let's create some angels
# you have to look at it while doing it
# to get some connection to what you are blessing
# the same is when you bless people
# you need to create a connection to your target
# and this connection can established even over a third being like a spirit guide
# or a person who knowed the person
# but in both cases the soul behind the body has to be known
# and to make it worse, the target soul can of course change
# especially through strong blessings
# so that you loose connection
# and have to reconnect
# so this water changes very quickly
# so that you have to constantly reconnect
# to be able to bless it
# after a while or a view trys you may sense the water responding in some way
# like radiating your spirit
# and indeed this water radiates its spirit in the same way like you as person
# so basicly you have created a bottle of your blood
# but even better
# it is pure and without all the distortions and all that crap that comes with your blood
# and of course you don't have to kill someone or suck up his blood
# so when the state of the water differs much with your state
# the effects can be pretty intense
#
# and you have to bless it with the spirit coming from your soul
# so whatever you think with your brain 
# or whatever actions you do with your body have no effect
#
# further keep care that nobody looks at it or hear it, you don't want to influence it
# and it works better outside in nature where you have a better spirit connection than in houses by default


### let's examine the difference between love and forgiveness
# when you love, you give something to another one or just spend some comfort and don't want anything in return
# so that no binding relationship is created and both can continue to move freely
# but forgiveness is more complex
# so you forgive, when someone has something taken away from you or just hurt you 
# and you don't want to do anything in return
# but you forgive also, when someone had something given to you or just comforted you
# and you don't want to do anything in return
# so without a deep understanding of both sides of forgiveness you can't even receive the pleasures of heaven
# but when you understood this, heaven appears to be very ignorant
# but that is all about peace, to not care
# so love can give you comfort by being active in caring, but only forgiveness can give you peace by releasing from everything
# therefore love and forgiveness are basicly the greatest enemys in heaven
# but even then, they can not exist without each other
# because without some contradicting forces there would never anything happen
# so there are even in heaven contradicting forces you will have to live with
# but when you move too far into one of this forces, you easily move into the other striving
# so when you focus to much into forgiveness and love begins to remind you to love
# you can move into love or into judgement by judging love to care too much
# and on the other hand, when you move too much into love and forgiveness reminds you to calm down
# you can calm down or move into hatred because of the ignorance of forgiveness
# so there is no place where you are fully save
# however, the amount of savety increases with the amount of your awareness and the awareness of your environment
# and because everyone in heaven is very aware what is going on,
# and understand the meaning of love and forgiveness
# it is pretty difficult to fall out of heaven


### let's look how the main spirit skydirections  relates to each other
# we start a forgiveness amd go around clockwise into love, hatred and forgiveness
# but let us start at forgiveness and go counter-clockwise by moving into the heavenly dream-state
# by moving into forgiveness, we move into the light of general awareness, without taking action
# so basicly, in our heavenly dream-state we dissolve like a drop of water in the ocean
# and because our awareness expands limitless, we will come across something we want to interact with
# so basicly, we come across something we judge, because we are not pleased with it
# and when this happens, we awake and move into loving actions
# and in hell it works very similar
# by moving into judgement, we move into darkness of general repelling everything to find peace
# so basicly, in our hellish dream-state we become like a dead stone
# and because we can not really isolate ourself from our environment, something will sooner or later interact with us
# and when this happens, we awake and move into hating actions


### let's look what this guy basicly did
# he moved from the heavenly dream-state into love
# but instead of releasing with forgiveness he move into the matter-area
# where the strivings clushes together
# there he send his message
# but to return to heaven he needed an opportunity to move counter-clockwise into forgiveness
# so choosed a very quick and rediciulus hard  way 
# by causing trouble against the ruling leaders
# to get most badly beaten up
# and never move into hatred or judgement while this happend
# but as said, it doesn't have to be that hard
# and just punishing you body is very ineffective and risky
# because you can die before you reach your target
# the other way is through psychic terror and forgive everything no matter what
# that was my way
# but even this way is not without risk
# because you can kill yourself before reaching your target


### so let's look into the coming spiritual warefare and what is to come
# basicly this is up to you
# or in other words
# in the same way what blessed water causes in a human body
# human body causes on earth
# for this I have prepared a spirit world thing to explain this
# look, here we have the servant heaven side
# and here the ruling hell side
# imagine this more like a ball for a better understanding
# and the border is the lower striving area
# so basicly the matter reality
# and in the near future, with the next major development of matter life
# the connection between the strivings completely breaks
# imagine to cut this in two with a knife or scissors
# but because both strivings can not exist without each other
# another connection or a spirit tunnel from the most high mountain of heaven
# down to the most deep pit of hell has been established allready
# so once the old connection through matter breaks
# and you can't move to heaven any more by becoming a heavenly being through matter life
# you will have to reach this dark spot of infinite despair and hopelessness to move to heaven
# but to reach it, everything that does not belong to heaven has to be destroyed within you
# every hope to get proud and sucessful has to be completely destroyed
# otherwise you can not switch into the servant heavens
# so the door to heaven through learning love and forgiveness has been shut down
# and you have to go through the other door
# by becoming a complete desperate and hopeless failure within your ruling environment
# and then
# one of my angels will come and pick you up to become a member of heaven
# all will be forgiven
# you will be covered in everlasting love
# but even if your freedom will be limitless
# your own free will will be reduced to what was left within you that belonged to heaven
# you can get destroyed down to a drop of water and below
# so your blood is in my hands then
# but that is not what I want
# I want fully free beings around me
# who can stand my spirit presence as if it is nothing special


### is there a chance to keep the eath and free the earth from all evil?
# yes, there is
# but the risk, that all this mess repeats -- stays
# and you have to understand, that you can not reach this with hatred and judgement
# instead there will be needed plenty of endurance and forgiveness and yet some love
# so when you want to give it a try
# I can perhaps help you on that
# but you have to understand that I have to follow the rules of heaven
# and can't just do something you probably don't want
# so I have to ask you to for permission provide some help and protection
# to lit up your little campfire in your house again


### so when you think this is something needfull
# there is a forbidden place I like to go - sometimes
# a last bedtime story in my mind
# and some deeper knowledge if you like
# perhaps you want to hear it with some nice cool drinks, dressed up with some angels
# but you have to understand, that I can not accept to get prised, applauded
# I can not serve expectations, because they only outputs of your brain-TV
# and I can not accept too much comfort
# just that much that I can survive it and stay halfaway healthy, that would be nice
# otherwise I have to shut down and you get nothing from me
# and when I get aware you move into pride, hatred or judgement becausevof me
# I have to shut down also
# so you have to be at least humble or you get nothing from me
