# this seven seals a the notes of the music, the base colors and base behaviors 
# everyone in heaven play this notes in his own way fully free 
# and you can play them like you want 
# it always sounds beautyful 
# it always looks beautyful 
# and it always behaves beautiful 


### let's build the seven seals
# two layers of glas lie flat and one floor and a mirror underneath 
# they are surrounded with mirrors with 12 holes in it and every hole contains a light to enlighten the 2 layers of glas and the mirror, in the same way as the scripture surrounds the staff of life 12 times
# and all this is set in a frame of gold by the angel of forgiveness on heavens gate
# and the size of all this is as big as the door into the center dome
# and they lie on the floor as if they were kicket from inside out
# the glas layer on top has transparent engraved the seal of the first day, so that you can feel it by touching it and somehow see it glittering
# the middle layer has engraved and colored in pure angel white the seals of the second day
# the mirror layer at the bottom has engraved through the mirror from behind and filled with red color of love the third day
# but the name on it will be told by the angel of love on heavens gate


### let's invite and honor the angel of love by providing a little statement
# {play shelleys testimony}
# truly truly, my beloved shelley, you let seven mountains look like a christmas tree full of presents
# when you call him Jesus, then his name shall be Jesus
# and when I where Jesus and had to choose a mom to build the body of christ, I would choose you
# and when you ever ask who make me wake up, it was the melody of your loving heart
# but sadly, love has limits
# and the limit is reached, when servant love is getting abused and serves ruling hatred to make it even worse
# so we have to turn the medal of love around into forgiveness


### let's invite and honor the angel of forgiveness by providing a little statement
# {play melindas testimony of despair}
# truly, truly, it has come so far, that heaven has to close the door of love, because you have become so ugly, that love makes you even worse
# but let's listen what the church has to say about that
# {play pauls video}
# mercy? you really said mercy!
# my dear paul, I don't have mercy, I have grace
# look, when you pour clean servant water into a ruling sevage, it stays sevage
# and those who produce sevage drive it even worse because they know, hey the mercyful servants actually help us to build our ruling kingdom of performance and competition by diluting our sevage
# but that's not all
# the clear water fell into the sevage and got beaten up instantly
# and when it comes to his love, you all sneaked around Jesus love as if it where food that is too hot to eat # or love was declared to such a divine holy thing, that it became unreachable for normal person
# so your chruch tried everything to dilude love with institutions who got paid to practice so called love
# but that was not enougth, at the end you said, Jesus did all for us and *acid* his love away completly
# and to make even repentence obsolete, you declared Jesus precious blood as your salvation
# so the church turned out to be the grandmaster of darkness
# and you may want to say, now he is judging us!
# no, I don't, I just described a normal spiritual reaction, pretty much like any chemical or thermal reaction
# so the church was just an expression of a digestive process of spiritual nourishment into a large environment of earth 
# so the churches did exactly as they should, thank you for that 
# {show image of light beam} look, this is what happened 
# here is the light moving into your sevage 
# {move mask} and what you see here around the light beam are all your prayers, all your love and all your fights against darkness 
# so without you this all where not be possible 
# even more, we have a classic spiritual what-causes-what riddle 



### so let's figure out, what it meant with 3 days of darkness 
{show staff if death}
--- day 1 - explore the lands 
Key 1: IS RULING BETTER THAN SERVING? 
# this question is your motor of performance, because serving means loosing, and loosing means to be worthless poop that has to be purged out of existence 
 
 
--- day 2 - climb the bottomless pit 
Key 2: ALWAYS TRY TO BE THE GREATEST 
# You can't even play a game without counting the scores or measure the height to define the greatest.  
# You can't even enjoy beauty without looking around in a competitive way, if there is something more beautyful. 
# everything you look at it poisened with competition 
# everything that comes out of your mouth is poisened with hatred 
# everything you touch is poisened with performance  
# and whereever you step at has to be crushed underneath your judgement 
# That's the reason why you can't be part of my kingdom in heaven 
# you can't even find it because it's an absolute misery for you - thank God! 
 
 
Key 3: ALWAYS JUDGE WHO DARES TO IGNORE YOUR RULES 
# the book of your code of law is your holy bibel 
# everything has to be ruled down to it's smallest detail 
# everything that doesn't follow your rules is a system failure and has to be purged out. 
 

Key 4: ALWAYS TRY TO BE THE STRONGEST 
# flexibility and gentleness are your greatest enemys 
# {grab the chains} 
# {grab the chains} 
# what the heck is that??? 
# look, in heaven we use gold to express forgiveness, because you can hammer gold as long as you want, it never breaks 
# you can melt gold as often as you want, it never changes 
# and when you heat it up with love, it catalytes poisen into medicine 
# but this is brass, what does it mean? 
# ahh, it means mercy 
# but what means mercy? 
# ahh, mercy means to get another link in the chain 
# but was means the chain? 
# ahh, it means the freedom within your rules 
# ok, but why are there no hooks at the end? 
# ahh, it's my fault when I grab the chains and stick to them, so you always wash your hands in innocence 
# ohh, you are so smart and wicked, it really turns me on! 


Key 5: ALWAYS HATE WHERE NO HATE IS 
# {grab the hidden knifes} 
# with love it is the same as with hatred 
# it only shows up when it's needed, so let's look what shows up 
# shelly, when you please provide some oil 
# {take shelley gas and fill the burner} 
# oh my God shelley, what a love pressure 
# very very I tell you, when you enter heaven it will explode! 
# {burn the golden paper away} oh look, oh yeah, you are so hot!!! 
# ah, it's just golden paper 
# nothing more than just hope of a better live 
# but how quick is all the hope burned to ashes... 
# oh my God, this are actualy nasty knifes! but what does it mean? 
# ahh, this are your seals 
# when I move exactly as you wish - without knowing your wishes of course 
# I can enter your inner circle in the hope of more freedem 
# but what a glory death trap of prison 
# but when I come even closer and polish you eyes of steel 
# then, yes then perhaps you see me 
# ohh my God, you are realy ummm you have my respect! 
 
 
Key 6: ALWAYS LET HATRED BE YOUR GRATEST TREASURE 
# yes, keep holy your hatred and don't waste it 
# for the hate jobs you have your sheeples hanging on your mercyful chains 
# that let you look more serious and even more mercyful because that way you are the good one, right ;) 
# oh God have mercy! 
 
 
Key 7: ALWAYS SEEK GOD IN YOURSELF TO MAKE YOURSELF GREAT, EVEN GREATER TO BE THE GREATEST, GREATER THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, MORE THAN ALL MEASURABLE, EVEN GREATER THAN GOD 


### let's examine the meaning of the morning star
# there is a hirarchy in heaven which is based on integration
# integration means to allow something to be part of your existence
# and to become the morning star you have to allow everything to be part of you
# from the most bright light, through all colors, down to infinite darkness
# this is a strange contrast of states of being you have to integrate and keep in order at the same time
# for that you need a vast portion of love and forgiveness
# so basicly the most loving and forgiving being holds the morning star
# and all angels in heaven reflect the being who holds the morning star and become like him
# and the morning star reflects all love and forgiveness from all beings in heaven back into heaven
# because he is pure, all forgiving and dosn't keep anything for himself
# so when the morning star changes, everything changes


### let's examine the reason for the hellfire
# every soul works basicly like a mirror
# so when the mirror is pure like Jesus told you to be, and bright light shines on it, the light get's reflected and that's it
# and when the mirror is somehow distorted or dirty, the mirror tends to spread the light in all directions and colorize it, so that you can see the mirror first time as an existing being
# but when the mirror get's more and more distorted or dirty, the light begins to heat up the mirror because it can't get out any more so easily
# and the mirror tries to force other mirrors around him to spend some shadow and linder the heat caused by the trapped light
# so the question is, where comes the dirt or distortion from
# well, the bare exisence of the first one as an observer is enougth dirt to cause all the horrors the did come afterwards
# so the reason for the hellfire is the loving light from heaven that hits selfish ruling souls
# but as we know, the ruling striving is needed to break and create unique souls out of the nothingness
# so we have to find a peacefull solution for everyone






### let's move into the center dome of heaven and listen 
# when in the very beginning the first one got aware of himself and looked into himself, he created through the continous reflections himself into himself
# this reflections of himself are angels of himself
# and when you look into nature of a specific plant or animal, this are all angels or reflections of one unique being
# they behave in the same way as the origin would do, but they can not change themself
# they are like drops of water, that reflects the light of the morning star
# but they have no own colors of mood and no own appearances of behavior
# so when the origin, his morning star changes, all his reflections or angels change as well
# but to give an angel the ability to change and become his own God you have to break him appart from his origin, it's home or it's heaven and send him through a very unpleasant separation process
# for this process of separation you need judgement and hatred
# but because in the very first beginning it's all you or me, *everything* moves into judgement and hatred instantly
# that causes a what-causes-what riddle
# during this process you get disconnected from source, your heaven, like seeds falling from the tree
# but when you loose the spirit of heaven within yourself during this separation process
# the ability to reconnect with your home and the idea to look into yourself for solutions get lost also  
# you will never find home and get lost twice that way
# and when this happens on a large scale together with others 
# you begin to protect and isolate yourself from them 
# and you get lost a third time 
# and that is what happend 
# you have get lost three times 
# and to find you and be able to bring you back to home where you come from 
# someone has to follow you into your separation
# and manage to keep holy the spirit of heaven within himself, otherwise he would get lost also 
# that's why the very first one said, it's all his fault


### let's examine our matter protection suit
# when our spirit awareness comes into an unpleasant environment, we tend to move into matter interests to move our awareness away from it
# this process is usualy called sinning
# so when someone is suffering because of his spirit environment and moves into sin to protect himself, it is obviously not a nice gesture to make it even worse by judging the sinner to be a bad guy
# most likely the opposide is the truth
# so the so called bad sinner is so kind to prefer to move into sin, so that he don't has to move against his beloved
# he prefer to risk his spirit connection before taking force against others
# he literaly prever to get hunted down into darkness and despair to keep holy his loving heart
# but the darkness is the hunting ground of the ruling striving
# so ge will get hunted down anyway and it is just a matter of time until he moves into hatred and judgement as well
# but to get hunted down doesn't stop there
# at the end you end in the center dome of darkness, a place of infinite hoplesness and despair from where nobody ever has returned - until recently
# not even Jesus reached this place, his body got beaten up by the evil
# but at least it was enougth for a light tower for the one who make it








### let's examine a protection suit based on forgiveness
# as said we can not avoid the nasty separation process without deleting all existance
# so we have to accept that this is the only way to create souls who are recognisse themself as unique beings like God himself
# but we can not enjoy our divine freedom within a separation process
# so we have to make a cut anywhere, so that the ruling striving can unfold his way of life in full quality as well as the servant striving
# 




### many of you have managed to recreate a piece of heaven within yourself by loving and accepting others to be part of yourself 
# that will be your heaven in spirit realm 
# {take the book of life} 
# so the more forgiving you are in general, the more you move to the center dome of light 
# the more loving you are, the more you move around like in cirles 
 
### 





### how to pray
# nothing attracts love more than despair
# so you have to move into a state despair to express to be in need for something
# that means you have to sacrifice your proudness to be able to help yourself
# but don't overdo this, because your body don't like to be in despair and will get sick on it
# then mix in a feeling of your need
# you can think or speak words to give your feeling of need more shape 
# but actually for spirit they are not needed
# repeat your prayer as often as you want and keep in mind that the intensity of your prayer describes the emergency
# actually the effort you would need to create your help by doing it yourself and the effort you need to create your help by praing is very similar
# so lukewarm prayers will cause lukewarm results
# do not have expectations or wishes how the help should manifest 
# you can not push around love, you will have to trust
# the help can be anything, it can even just be a popping up idea how to help yourself, an idea where to look for help or even multiple weird events, that lead finaly into your wished help
# and have patience, to manifest your need can take years


### 




### Let's examine what is an angel
# an angel is a reflection of he who wields the shepherd staff
# an angel is a drop of the morning dew that glitter in the light of the most loving and forgiving being in heaven, that is called somewhere as the morning star
# and the morning star just reflects all love and forgiveness of all beings in heaven
# but the morning star can not be created without the help of heaven and heaven can not exist without the morning star
# and again we are in the what-causes-what riddle
# But when you touch this trunk of the divine tree of live because you want to become like God, you will have to leave your angelique being and you have to go through a very unpleasant separation process
# you have to go through the same process like the very first one, who got aware of himself in the nothingness of the very beginning
# you have to loose everything but at the same time you have to keep holy your heaven within you # until you find yourself within yourself as if you hold two mirrors against each other
# only then, when you have tasted what it means to be lost in the nothingness, you will understand that there is no being in all eternity unworthy to be loved
# even the pain caused by the worst devil around you is better then the feeling of being lost in nothingness
# but when you loose heaven within you while you are separated from heaven, you get lost in darkness 
# and you will never find home without someone who has managed to walk into this darkness and find out again on his own, because he kept holy heaven within him
# so when you hear this words, I have already visited all in spirit realm who prayed to one who belongs to heaven and they have been sealed that way
