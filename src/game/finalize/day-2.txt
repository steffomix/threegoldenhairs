### the most primitive states of being are the ruling striving and its counterpart, the servant striving
# in the state of servant striving we dissolve in general awareness into our environment like a drop of water dissolves into an ocean
# or like two clean and undistorted mirrors who are looking into themselves
# and this deep reflection cause the impression of light
# and in this light we get at first aware of everything, that is close to our state of being or have similar colors and enlightenment
# and the more we dissolve in general awareness, the more we get aware of colors, who are unlike us
# and we do this until we got aware of something we want to interact with
# and to be able to interact, we focus or collapse our awareness back and solid into an expression of ourselves
# in the colors or state of being we want to be
# in an appearance, that describes our behavior
# so the reason of interaction is like a mark, that grabs and holds our awareness as long as we allow it
# but when we get stuck in the awareness of a mark, we can not dissolve into a general awareness anymore
# and our mark or the reason that grabs our awareness turns into a mark of a beast
# because the reason of our awareness tries to hold us focussed to the reason
# and when we can not dissolve into general awareness anymore, everything becomes dark around us
# and when many souls get stuck in a state of collapsed awareness, they move into an forced relationship against each other
# and with the forced relationship they create the ruling environment
# and the only way to become some distant and freedom in a ruling environment is by repelling others
# but by reppelling everything becomes even darker
# so the only way to come together again in a ruling environment is by setting up rules of general or uniformed behavior
# and uniformed behavior means uniformed appearance
# but setting up general behaviors suppress the need of freedom even more
# and the suppressed freedom causes hatred against the suppressors and the suppressing environment
# and the suppressors try to suppress the hatred with judgement and even more rules
# so everything becomes more and more tight and compressed
# and everything begins to move against each other in a competitive way
# so that only who performs the most hatred against others becomes the most freedom
# and those who are not strong enougth or just refuse to hate and judge are crushed down into a pitchblack bottomless pit of infinite despair and hopelessness or second death
# from where nobody ever returned on his own
# until latelely
# and that changes everything
# so this day we learn how to move out of the bottomless pit, back into the heavens we once come from
# but because it's a long road, we need some food
# so let's move into the kitchen and make some white bread


### let's clean up the kitchen first to receive white flour first
# in spirit we walk by trust, but our kitchen, that's our brain 
# but our brain works only by predictions and expectations
# and when our expectations don't match our predictions, our brain uses judgement to fix that
# and when we can't fix the reason, that causes the missmatch, we are going to repel or destroy the reason
# and when we can't destroy or repel the reason, we experience fear
# so, as long we focus on our brain activity, we can not move into spirit
# but we don't need to keep the kitchen clean for long, because in spirit informations are transported allways within a fingersnip
# and we don't have to wish anything or pray for it, because in spirit we walk by trust
# so just trust
# the only thing we can do in addition, is attracting love
# and nothing attracts love more than it's counterpart, despair
# so feel free to move into a state of despair
# but keep in mind, that your matter body environment don't like to be in despair and will get sick on it after a while
# so don't abuse despair as an love attractor


### let's create a spirit environment if not already created
# well, this is really the easiest of all
# for love the servant way just imagine it is early in the morning, the sun is croaching like a thief underneath the horizon and the morning clouds are gently settling down to bless the weak at first and the useless the most whereas the great and strong have deep roots to gather their blessings by themself, so that everything can grow up in peace and comfort safely
# for love the ruling way just you summon dark clouds for heavy rain to break the weak and drown the useless, you summon fiery praying storms of judgement and heavy winds of hatred to blow all away that dares to be greater than you, so that everything get destroyed in performance and competition safely
# but in forgiveness, the sun is shining on bright midday on everyone and everything no matter what
# that's it, easy as that
# but because it is so easy, let's repeat it with some nice images
# {show images from ezekiel chapter one and repeat}
# just if you wonder, where the eyes are, you are one of them


### let's learn to shutdown the brain for just a moment
# to make sure we receive our flour directly into the kitchen or brain of being up and awake
# we have to be completely awake and have to keep our eyes open
# now we are looking for a high contrast point to look at
# something like a bright spot on a dark background or something we hold in our hand, so that all behind blurs, because it is more far away
# and we can even use just our finger
# now we try to think nothing, don't even have any emotion
# and we do that with all willpower we can bring together for at least 10 seconds, but not longer than 10 minutes
# and we can do it as if you are lifting heavy weights, like in regular muscle training
# or like a woman who has labor contractions and trys to push her baby out
# so as said, the willpower you bring up is all that counts
# and you need to bring up that willpower from your soul
# so don't try to think to think nothing, that does not work
# when you are successful, you should become a little dizzy
# and you may even feel, that your spirit environment change a little
# and after a while you will have hard times to stay awake, because the need for sleep becomes overhelming
# and when you have problems with addictions or attractions of any kind, they will become very intense
# because you try to rip them off like a tape from the skin
# so addictions will become overhelming temporarily
# if so, just try to withstand as long as you can, before moving into hatred or judgement against your self
# and when you can't withstand any more or fall asleep, it's ok, nobody cleans a complete house in one strike
# and when you fell asleep and awake, you can be breathless or like under shock, because you died for a little moment
# but you mostly will not instantly remember what you have experienced, because you brain needs time to render or translate your spirit experience into a matter story or images from where you can translate back it's meaning
# because in spirit we are only meaning and have to express or dress it into a colorful form with a behavior
# but in matter it's the opposite, the meaning is hidden under countless expression layers
# so the only way to back to spirit is to break through all this layers
# but when you have no idea, what the difference is between words and meanings, you will barely bring you willpower from you soul to work and quickly move into hatred and judgement instead
# and yes, you can completely disconnect from your body and die that way


### let's look how we look in spirit and what angels are
# {use mirror on mirror} for this we put two mirrors against each other
# and at one of them we remove a little from it's reflection layer to look through
# when the mirrors are flat, paralel undistorted and clean, we can see a vast amount of reflections
# and all this reflections are your spirit eyes, who are actually angels of you
# so the better your inner mirror works, the brighter becomes your spirit vision
# for example, when you look to much on yourself by putting this mirrors close together, you reduce your spirit vision
# or when they are not parallel, you turn into a sideway
# and a sideway is like a branch growing on a tree in the servant striving or like a side-root in the ruling striving
# but there is no way to make the mirrors complete pure, because you would delete the observer that way
# and without an observer everything disappears into nothingness
# so the cause for all existence and all the mess that comes with it afterwards is the very first observer itself


### let's look what has changed in our kitchen
# when or brain workout was successful, we have caused some ruptures into the global spirit environment we belong to
# and through this ruptures we will have new kind of sensations we have to get used to
# and our brain will always try to render this sensations into something meaningful on its own
# but that's not what we want, because that would be just like watching scary and fearful brain television
# we want to stay so close to unrendered spirit as possible
# so whatever you see, hear or feel in a matter way or even emotionaly, that should not be there, don't give any attention to it
# that does not mean that its not there at all
# it does mean, that you have to learn to differ between matter impressions through your brain has created on its own
# and spirit impressions through your soul you have to translate into matter expressions on your own
# and you have to learn where are intersections of both
# for example you may sense a weird person near you, that is actually the person in front of you, but you sense its true spirit first time in your life 
# and when you can't believe they are the same, then your brain will try to create another person for you
# so the more ruptured your body armor is, the more transparent the bodys of others will become as well
# but you have to rupture completely trough all your separation layers into your wake and opened eyes consciuosness, otherwise you will have to live with dreams or astral travels when it comes best, but you never really break through and see things as they really are


### Let's learn how to move in heavens kitchen
# Heaven never command or judge you in any way
# instead heaven will always try to explain you how things work to become a better understanding
# and most likely you get a little loving touch in addition
# heaven teaches you by providing a view from states of being you have not jet discovered
# So it's pretty much like you do all day in matter life, when you walk around a thing to examine it from different angles of view
# and what you do with this knowledge afterwards is completely on you
# that means, when you do things that was not so nice, an angel may come and show you these things from different states of being to become a better understanding what you are doing
# and this is the only way to learn something in spirit, by moving into different states of being and get aware of the changes
# but we live in a body, wich provides plenty of armor, so that we get very slowly and smooth in contact with new impressions from different states of being
# what we do now is some kinda dry run for life in spirit
# and we do this with drawing in the most easiest way possible
# so the less experienced you are in drawing the better
# with this we learn how to differ brain thoughts from spirit impressions while being fully awake
# so it’s an extension of the meditation you should do before for a view seconds
# for this exercise you can use any material that leaves visible trails
# like flat stones to scratch on, Sand to draw in with your finger or a stick, or modern with paper and pencil
# but don’t show anyone your draws easily, because the risk to run into judgement is just too big in this matter reality
# so keep holy your drawings and show only well trusted persons
# while drawing don’t put your tool down and wait for commands
# that will never happen, heaven never command anyone
# just keep moving in the same way as you are used to do in your normal life
# to become a better understanding imagine you have a pot with nice and clean water in it
# you put the water on a stove to bring some warming love into it, that's actually you
# but don't make the water too hot, so that it begins to boil in emotions
# just like that you can see little bubbles of air of a loving servant presence on your humble ground, that's the best
# now put some matter expression like a person you know in your mind into your pot of warm water
# you do that just by focus on this person
# now take your spoon or your pencil and just stir it as gentle as possible to move the taste from the ingriedients into the water
# after a while you will feel, that you spoon or pencil feels more confident on some places than on others
# and wher you feel like that, give your tool a little more pressure
# so when you have a little feeling of it, than you have all you need
# and your feeling will become a little more shape with each try
# but every times you draw another picture of the same person it looks different
# this is because the knowledge or life experience you got from the prior images have become part of the reality you look at and change it's outcome
# but don't expect nice drawings, that's not the purpose of the exercise
# the purpose of the exercise is to learn the differences between the feeling you get from spirit and the predictions and expectations coming from your brain
# and the biggest challenge comes up, when you see first shapes of what you draw
# that's because you have to do this exercise while being fully awake
# only that way you can get stronger against you biggest enemy, your own brain
# and only that way you learn to separate the wheat from the chaff


### let's bring some more heat into your stove
# in heaven all we need literaly condensates out of nothing in the most gentle way possible
# this is because everything is in a servant striving and loves to serve the needs from others
# and there is nowhere a need to present us as the server
# so that all who feel a need try to serve the need in a hidden way
# this is because in heaven we know that all focus on our self disturbs our inner mirror and cause darkness
# and we know that we cause a mark of awareness by putting our self into the focus of others and reduce their vision as well
# so in heaven it's all about God and that is just everything that surround us
# and once you understood this, it should be no problem to server others like that in your very own way
# or just enjoy the beauty of heaven like the gras waves in the mild sommerwinds
# so whatever you do in heaven, nobody will judge you for that
# as long you keep holy the spirit of heaven and don't do anything that destroys it


### let's finally climb the mountain
# well, we allready did
# yes, that's it, so easy
# that's the fascinating thing in spirit
# when you can not make the sun rising that causes the morning dew
# then just make some morning dew and the sun will rise
# so when you can't climb the mountain of Gods insane love
# then just love anyhow and you begin to climb the mountain
# so when you don't understand the meaning of forgiveness
# then just try to forgive and you will begin to understand it
# but you should know, that you can not climb the mountain love only for your self


### let's exermine the mountain
# the mountain on it's own is basically a meaningless solid rock of integrity or the man part
# and everything that grows on it gives the mountain it's meaning or the woman part
# but when the meaning overgrows the mountain that much, that it literaly disappears
# the meaning looses the connection to it's integrity
# then you judge the meaning at one side and make the mountain stronger on the other side
# and that is what was done all the time over and over again
# but at a certain point the meaning begins to create it's own reality with it's own integrity
# and that is the point when everything begin to break appart
# and to make it worse, in spirit we have the weird what-causes-what riddle that makes it literaly impossible to figure out what exactly is the reason for all the mess
# does love cause forgiveness or does forgiveness cause love?
# are servants the reason for rulers or are rulers the reason for servants?
# does imperfection cause judgement or does judgement cause imperfection?


### let's look at the difference between love and forgiveness
# when we love, we give something from us or comfort someone but we want nothing in return
# when we forgive, something has taken from us or someone made caused pain to us but we want nothing in return
# so love and forgiveness are just two sides of the same medal
# but when they are the same thing that look different only because they are viewed from a different point of view
# then imperfection and judgement are two sides of the same medal
# as well as ruling and serving are just two sides of the same medal
# as well as repentence and despair are just two sides of the same medal
# that's why spirit gates are so nasty to use 
# and it is so difficult to find the way back
# so when this is true, then the tip of the mountain and the bottomless pit are just two sides of the same medal
# and it should be pretty easy to find they way back once you know how things work
# but there is only one way to figure this out
# we have to leave this place and move straight down into the bottomless pit of second death
# so let's do it!
# let's figure out if the universe caused the earth or the earth caused the universe


### let's prepare for the deadly mission and look if we really understood everything right
# {play shelleys testimony}
# truly truly shelley, you let seven mountains look like a christmas tree full of presents
# I am completely speechless about so much inner beauty
# truly I tell you, when you enter heaven, and you will, the angels will have to put on sunglasses to not get blind on all that exploding beauty
# because every time when one come back into heaven who has heaven in his heart, it is allways as if two heavens merge together and all the beauty in it doubles
# and the guy you was talking about, made a real nice tunnel
# but his tunnel works only in an environment where your love did not get abused
# and that is the problem we have now, love is getting abused that much, that love makes others only worse
# but when love and forgiveness is the same, it should be possible to return to heaven only with forgiveness
# so let's create a matter expression of his tunnel {show spirit of heaven three times}
# this will be the little piece of white bread we have to keep holy
# and it will burn like hell in our heart when we look at it while being lost in the darkness
# but without that we have no chance to find back the way home
# so let's gonna die the second death
