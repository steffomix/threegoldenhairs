♦Whoever look at this Staff and find himself in the Seven Seals on it will live in heaven. But when only one Seal is broken, you will not see heaven.*

♦The 7 seals of heaven are separated in 3 days:
- One seal on the first day of Moses - Childhood
- Five seals on the second day of Yeshua - Puberty
- One seal on the third day of the Lord - Majority

♦The second and third day has a witness:
The first witness is forgiveness - Melinda Key Lyons - Most high angel of the third day of majority, belongs to he who is like god, that is Me.
The second witness is love - Shelley L. Sherrill - Most high angel of the second day of puberty, belongs to that adolescent brat Jesus Christ.

♦That kiddo Moses, who doesn't understood anything right belongs to the first day of childhood.
This brat turned my recommendation of caring into 10 horns of terror and torment.
He said: "Do not steal" but I said only: 
When your environment has become so ugly, that some need to steal for whatever reason, who's fault is it? So when you want to know the conditions of your environment, then just steal and you know. That's why I always come like a thief in the night.
However, he was a kiddo, so it's all my fault!

♦All churches, religions and those who go along with them belong to poop, garbage and lukewarm sevage. Thank you for your service of being a carrier, you are not longer needed.

♦Thanks to all rulers and demons for creating servants and angels and make them stronger but you are no longer needed also.

*It provides also plenty of healing effects, clear spirit sight and pure life energy for free!*

♦You have questions? Ask Melinda, she is way better in talking than me and is the only one I will talk with from now on.

♦At last the text from my shepherd staff:
Is ruling better than serving?
Always try to be the least
Always try to forgive where you want to judge
Always try to be gracious where you want to close your heart
Always try to love where no love is
Always try to let love be your most precious treasure
Seek God in □□□□□□□ to love, to love and again to love, more than anything in the world, more than anything measurable and more than your live

♦is the last word "live" wrong? Your life you have anyway, so it makes no sense to mention it
♦□□□□□□□? Everything that surrounds you.
