### let's make 3 checks for vital signs of how much live is left in you
# so here is the first check:
# do you know that when you throw a stone to someone, that there is a probability, that this stone come back somehow? Yes? Oh, nice!
# and you know, that this can also happen with words you talk to others? Yes? Oh nice!
# and you also know that there is no difference between talking words and throwing stones, except a stone hits only one but words can hit many? Yes? Oh, nice, then there is at least a little chance, that you understand something from the third day and come to back to life through it
# but feel free to watch the other days for your amusement

# so let's make the second check:
# do you know that when someone orders you to bring him a branch from a tree, that there is a probabilty, that he will bring him not the branch you expected? Yes? Oh, nice!
# and you know, that there is a difference between words and it's inner meaning? Yes? Oh, nice!
# and you know, that spoken names are the chaff from their meaning, the wheat? Yes? Oh, nice, then there is at least a little chance, that you understand something from the second day and come to back to life through it
# but feel free to watch the other days for your amusement

# so let's make the third and last check:
# do you know the meaning of white bread and soured bread? Yes? Oh, nice!
# and you know, that when you eat only white bread, that there is a probability, that you never come to life? Yes? Oh, nice!
# and you know, that when you eat only soured bread and don't keep holy at least a small portion of white bread, that there is a probabilty, that you loose connection to your source and die? Yes? Oh, nice, then there is no need to watch anything of all that, because you can bring back to life your self on your own

# but if your answer to the first question was like: "I don't care about returning stones or words, for that I have my servants running!"
# and if your answer to the second question was like: "When you don't understand what I mean, it's your fault!"
# and if your answer to the third question was like: "I eat only what makes me stronger!"
# Oh, so sad! You are allready dead, but feel free to watch everything for your amusement


### let's go, no time to waste
# imagine this air here is nothing, so actually you can't see anything
# and all this nothingness is god
# and in this nothingness there is a 50/50 chance, that it develops an - at this point - undefined striving
# but due to lack of time this chance turns into 100% success
# and with this undefined striving god get aware of himself
# and by getting aware of himself he creates himself into himself
# but he can't create anything then himself, because there is nothing else then himself
# now we have God in God and the only thing that separates both from each other is the relationship to each other
# {use big mirror} so when now God in God get aware of God around him or in him, we have a situation as if you hold two mirrors against each other, which creates infinite Gods in God
# and because God is infinite in himself, the amount of reflections is limitless
# but there was an impurity since the very beginning of the awakening of God that caused all the mess we have today
# and we are going now to figure out what it is and how it all works
# but that's a long story


### let's take some stuff to visualize this
# {cristal} a piece of God (polished rock cristal)
# {a little net} to put the cristal in and render relationships
# {survival compass} to render a soul in a body, with a nice degree adjustment as striving dumping device, and even a mirror - nice!
# {magnet} to simulate the striving of another piece of god 


### let's take a piece of God and put some relationships on it {put cristal into net}
# every time a piece of God, actually a loul get aware of another one, he can accept it to be part of it or repel it
# but what the soul tends to do, depends on its striving
# when we allow something to be part of us, it is within us and we will care about it as if it is ourselves
# we call this love
# and the act of accepting or letting in we call forgiveness
# and the striving that causes forgiveness we call serving or a servant striving
# but when we don't allow something or someone to be part of ourselves, we will repel him like something that hurts us
# we call this hatred
# and the act of repelling or throwing out we call judgement
# and the striving that causes judgement we call ruling or a ruling striving
# but because the other one is just another aspect of ourselves, by ruling we repel ourselves out of ourselves, or in opposite by serving we integrate ourselves into ourselves
# so that way we become more fullness or mass and become calm in a servant striving
# but in a ruling striving we repel others to our outside where they appear like marks or this nodes on the net around this soul {show nodes on the net}
# and we become more emptiness or lightweight and panicking through it


### let's look at striving behaviors in separated and integrated systems
# in a separated system or the matter reality the strivings behave like free floating separated magnets
# and in an integrated system or the spirit realm the strivings behave like aligned shards within a big magnet
# so that in a separated system all the magnets or striving souls influence each other in a contradicting way
# and in an integrated system all the souls in it influence each other in a supporting way
# so when there are two ruling souls in a separated system, they will try to turn each other into a servant striving
# and when there are two servant souls in a separated system, they will try to turn each other into a ruling striving
# but in an integrated system they will support each other in the striving they currently are


### let's go look how a soul in a body or a separated system works
# for that we need to understand how this survival compass works
# first you need to find a place with very low magnetic influence like outside in the wilds
# now turn this alignment wheel to 0 degree or straight north
# {turn the compass to north}
# put a map underneath without turning the compass, so that the top points to north of the compass
# the top on maps is always north
# now make two endpoints for the path we want to walk amd dtaw or imagine a line between both
# now connect your waypoints with your compass by using it like a ruler
# make sure you don't turn the underlying map in any way
# {turn the compass} so, the compass is turned amd parallel to the way line now
# now turn zero-point of the alignment wheel to the north of the compass needle {turn the alignment}
# on the origin top you can read the degree or the direction now, you have to walk
# you should write it down and put it on a very save place, just for the case you run in trouble
# use the compass like a gun to point your target while looking through the mirror if the needle points to your custom aligned point of north
# now just walk from one aimed point to the next until you have reached the target


### let's translate the meaning of the compass to the soul in the body
# the alignment wheel represents the striving of our body environment we live in
# and let north be the servant striving and south the ruling striving
# the magnetic field of earth represents the global striving environment of the spirit world
# looking in the mirror means to look into the spirit world
# when the needle points to the same piint than our custom alignment wheel, we feel most confident in our body
# and when at the same time the alignment wheel is out of original north of the whole spirit world, we can see that in the mirror
# so as long our mirror is clean and undistorted we always know the true direction to where we are walking
# but when our mirror is full of mud of matter interests or in distorted moods, we can't see any more in what direction we are truly walking
# and by washing the mud of matter interests from our eyes on this mirror and bring our moods in order we can see again
# and when we have been walking blind for a long time and become true vision again or leave our body due to death for example, we may be very surprised where we have end up
# so the upside of our body armor suit is the isolation from spirit influence
# but when the isolation becomes too attractive and sticky or cause too much mood distortions, we easily walk blind and loose track of orientation
# {show image [[soul-in-body.png]]}


### let's look at the soul mass
# the more you allow to be part of you, the bigger is your soul mass
# and the stronger is your magnetizing influence
# and the more difficult it is to change your striving
# so that servant magnetize throug its heavy mass
# whereas a ruling soul with low mass has to establish his magnetizing effect through souls who are willing to serve him
# so that souls in a ruling striving always try to find other souls or a group of souls to participate from their mass, always try to bind them and try to move into the most ruling position
# whereas souls with a serving striving always try to go alone and serve everyone moves along without establishing a binding relationship


### let's look at the body functionality as a dumping device
# even an atom, nearly the smallest building block of matter is already a collection of many souls or shards of God
# therefore our body is a walking universe of souls we are in a relationship with and creates it's own spirit micro environment
# and when it comes in contact with other strivings, our body reacts on different strivings like a dumping device due to its vast complexity {use magnet on compass in a deceiving way}
# so when we get in contact with another striving, every time this dumping device moves a little {rotate the compass north point a little} and realign our striving to a new point where we feel comfortable
# when we do this often we would call this type of influence magnetizing or deceiving
# and due to the dumping effect of our body environment and it's very sneaky changing, we easily get used to a different striving
# and without a good vision through a clean and calm mirror into the spirit world, we barely get aware in what striving we actually are or we allready have turned to
# so every time we react ruling on whatever events, we dive a little deeper into ruling striving
# and the same is by reacting servant on whatever events


### let's look into the body and spirit behavior of time {take two plants}
# this side or the air reflects our global spirit environment
# and the plant in the air reflects the soul you have been grown to
# and the roots in the earth reflects your matter body
# and the earth the matter environment
# so, when you now make an intention in your soul, this intention has to materialize itself through the roots into the earth, or at least has to be rendered in your brain-part of your roots into an idea or inspiration
# but there are many stages of translation and materialisation of your intention that needs plenty of time
# whereas a direct communication through spirit in our air {show air side} takes no time at all, even the most complex conversations can be transmitted within a fingersnip {make a fingersnip}
# but because of the lack of time consuming conversation in pure spirit we run into a what-causes-what riddle
# pretty much like the instant reaction of magnets to each other, where you can not say, what magnet influences what
# it is like the question, what was created first, the egg or the chicken?
# this lack of time consuming interactions makes it impossible to make experiences about what-causes-what or who was acting first
# but when we live in a body, where everyone is encapsulated in his own spirit reality and the conversation takes time through all this separation- and translation layers like across all the roots to the roots of another plant, we can very well experience what-causes-what
# that way we can make very profound decisions, what we allow to be part of us, what we want to repel and how we want to align our striving in general


### let's look a little deeper into binding relationships marks
# every time another soul causes a forcing relationship to us, we have a relationship mark {point to the nodes of the net on the cristal} representing or reflecting the relationship we feel a force to
# this nodes work like chains that binds souls together
# we usually name this invisible forces "expectation", "debt" or "responsibility" to or from others
# this marks doesn't stand only for repelling relationships, they stand for any kind of force caused by this relationship
# that can be as well the idea we have to repay a pleasant action, so that the idea of a dept is the force that binds us to this relationship and cause a mark
# so that we can create this relationship marks only by our imagination and keep them alive that way
# in spirit realm this marks appear like outside reflections of other souls we expect something from
# so this marks basically create our spirit bodys
# in a very strong servant environment there are no bindings at all and therefore no separating bodys at all
# so that the souls literaly melt into each other like a drop of water dilutes in an ocean
# and in a strong ruling environment the souls are literaly buried in bindings
# but due to their repelling nature there is no communication possible even if they feel all relationships very vivid
# and in this matter world both strivings with very low strength clushes together and build very complex systems of entangled servant strivings, ruling strivings and even neutral or lukewarm strivings
# so this matter world is actually the battlefield between the strivings {primitive souls in an atom [[atom.png]]}


### let's look at states of being a soul can move into
# for this we use this mood map, usually called book of life {complete book of life [[complete-book-of-life.png]]}
# this colors describes the whole set of states of being you can also name as mood or ambience
# but states of being are based on the striving so that both strivings have their own set of states
# so there is a {servant set of states [[book-of-serving-life.png]]}
# and there is a {ruling set of states [[book-of-ruling-life.png]]}
# and at the outer borders in the most colorful area they look very similar
# and it is the area where both strivings are the weakest and the most unstable
# and it is the area of spirit warfare or the area of the matter reality {book of spirit warfare [[book-of-spirit-warfare.png]]}
# now our matter body is a universe of souls who can be in different states of being and even in different strivings
# but we as the leading soul of our body can only be in one striving and state at a time
# and the diversity of states we can move in depents on what we have conquered or allowed to be part of us
# when we now look into all the souls, who have integrated states of other souls, and all of them have done that in their own way, every soul develops a unique set of ingredients, that defines its spirit name or color set {use mask on book of life}
# and in the center of it the soul feels most confident and it's the souls home then
# and a soul can even be fragmented and becomes rooms with doors or gates through this


### let's look how to expand our book of life
# every time you move into a different state or mood of being or even change your striving, everything you have ever experienced looks different
# because you see everything from a different perspective of being
# even the state where you come from looks different
# so when you move out of your well known states of being, it can become pretty difficult to move back into your known states when you don't know how they look from there
# so you can really get lost in unknown states of being
# and it becomes absolute impossible, when you have bind yourself into ruling relationships, who always try to keep you on place for whatever reason
# that's why this binding ruling relationship marks are called marks of the beast
# so to really truly expand your book of life, you have to move into unknown states or moods and move back home on your very own
# only then you have mastered the unknown and have become the ability to move freely within then further on


### let's look at spirit gates and tunnels
# gates a connections between states within a striving and work only in one direction
# but gates are not really needed because in spirit we travel by changing our state of being
# so gates you find only very close to the matter like areas where the striving gets weaker
# for example, when you remember an atmosphere of a location like a pub or the living room from friends, in spirit realm you where there in that moment you create that atmosphere of the desired location within you
# but tunnels are connections between strivings and work in both directions
# and they are not just decorations
# tunnels are like pathes of conquer, created by strong souls who dived deadly deep into the enemy striving and returned
# but when the location to where one side of the tunnel ended change its state of being, the tunnel can become unreachable and useless


### let's look how to travel in spirit realm
# to travel in spirit realm on your own you have to adapt to the environment you want to travel to
# but when your target is out of your range, you can use another soul like a taxi or train
# for that the other soul or taxi has to move into your state of being and try to get your awareness first
# then your taxi or train has to get your trust
# because in spirit realm it is impossible to get a preview of your target without instantly moving to it
# so in spirit realm we can move only by trust and not by sight as we do in matter realm
# as soon as your taxi begins to move, you have to release your focus on where you currently are
# otherwise you would always snap back to your old state you come from
# and it becomes absolute impossible to move with your taxi, when you have bind yourself into ruling relationships, who always try to keep you on place for whatever reason
# that's why this binding ruling relationship marks are called marks of the beast
# now your taxi gently changes his state of being and you do also by focusing on your 
# once you moved into a very unknown state of being and feel confident there, you will snap into it
# and you will not be able to find the state of being where you did come from
# so once you really moved into a completely new state of being, the old one begins to vanish and becomes unreachable
# you would need a taxi again or a gate, that shows your old state of being from the perspective of your new state of being


### Keep your house in order
# every time we come across something that is not part of us or at least close to us, it feels disturbing {draw a contrast color point on a separated book of life, like a blue spot in a red area}
# in a situation like this contrast color point, it can become pretty difficult to integrate this without being in pain about the harsh borders
# in spirit realm we would connect this areas with gates or tunnels, but they are always a nasty and painful thing, disturbing the spirit harmony
# so mostly we try to repel such things out of our spirit reality completely
# but when we grow up in our experiences, become more diversity and with it more mass within us, we may be able to integrate things that we thought it is impossible to be with
# so the more we allow to be part of us, the more mass we become and the easier it becomes to integrate even more and the separated spots grow together
# but the more mass we become, the more difficult it becomes to change our striving
# because our ruling or serving striving is the most primitive state of being at all
# all meanings of our life, our lifestyle, all dreams we have for our life are based on them
# so once a striving has been chosen, we have to literally die for ourselves to change it


### let's look at behaviors of souls
# behaviors are based on states of being and are expressed in forms
# in a servant striving we become forms through other souls we please to surround us and they do so because they love to serve us
# in a ruling striving we become forms by ripping off other bodys and force other souls to be part of us
# when we now start a life on earth as a servant soul, but become a ruling striving through this and throw out all, or most of our servant souls, we begin to vanish out of the servant book of life and light and become a member of the ruling book of death and darkness {move mask from light servant to dark ruling area}
# so when we repel pretty much everything, we have nothing to look at any more and it becomes pretty dark then
# therefore the book of life is more likely a book of states a soul can adapt or move to, so when we focus on a soul and compare its state with this book, we know where it currently is
# and when this soul is in a state we have not yet experienced, for us this soul is vanished out of our book of life


### let's look into the spirit hierarchy of the servant striving and it's development
# the spirit hierarchy is basically expressed by inheritance
# to understand this, we need a book of life
# {take a book of life and mask a soul} here we mask out a soul
# when we now mask another soul within this soul, we have a child of it
# when this child is completely submerged in its parent, the child is pedigree
# and when they compare, they are like twins
# but very often souls are fragmented ore just not that round and there are only some overlappings
# these overlappings build the relatives
# and when a soul conquers new areas in its book of life, the soul can grow up to a parent of it's former parents or become at least new relatives
# so when you want to travel in spirit realm, you can be literally given from hand to hand until you reach the target
# and that is the reason why it is so difficult to travel in the ruling striving
# it's because nobody want's to serve you except you have something useful in return


### lets return to our compass and look what happens on death
# when we die, we leave the micro striving environment of our body
# and when we have relatives in the servant striving, a servant soul that is able to reach our state will greet us first
# if not, a ruling striving soul will welcome us
# however, when this soul has a stronger mass and has a different striving, we will be forced into his striving, because there are no contradicting effects any more like in a matter body
# and this forced switch into an opposite striving causes the well known life review, that can be very painful
# when this life review is too painful, we most likely move into a striving where we feel more comfortable
# but it can also happen, that we have completely no life review at all, because we had all the time small portions of life review during lifetime due to our awareness


### let's look on backfire
# due to the nature of being made out of one piece of God, everything we do to others, we do to ourselves
# this causes a backfire of all we do to others
# and in spirit realm this backfire returns instantly, without time delay
# and the lack of a time delay cause a what-causes-what riddle
# even when we get in touch with other souls by merging together, we feel the other soul instantly as if it is us
# but when we live in our separated micro environment of our body, this backfire is pretty much blocked or at least delayed as long we live in it


### So let's close this day with a nice bedtime story
# a story about a man who attempt to build a gigantic boat to carry all life on earth for a certain time secure over the rising waters
# probably you have heard of it
# in this story water represents ruling striving
# air for servant striving
# secure land for spirit realm
# and insecure land for the matter world
# the story began on land where this man had a solid stand
# but storms came up with heavy rains and the land became insecure
# and the man said by himself, when it continues to rain that strong, we all get drowned soon
# but his beloved wasn't strong and experienced enough to swim for an unpredictable amount of time
# so he began to collect plenty of wood of integrity to build a boat strong and big enough to carry all Life over the waters
# and all was laughing what he is doing with all the wood and for what this gigantic boat shall be used for
# and the waters raised up, the man put in all in his boat who trusted him
# and the boat began to swim and all the secure land began to vanish
# so the boat was lost in endless oceans full of storms and danger
# from time to time, when the weather was calm, the man was going on deck of his boat where he had a little dovecote
# he took a dove from it to send message in the hope of a response from a secure land where they can live
# and he said to the dove: "fly through the air and bring me a branch, where oil of love drips out. There we will head on and build our new home"
# so he did every day but the dove did always come back with an empty beak
# but one day the dove did come back with a branch where oil of love dripped out
# and the man said: "This is the land I searched for, let's head on it in the hope it stands the next storms"
# but every year new storms came up, and every times worse than before, so that he said: "I need more and more wood to stand the storms and carry all in need. That does not work for long any more, I have to invent something complete new!"
# so he rebuild the boat into a submarine made out of heavy Gold of forgiveness
# and cooled the walls with ignorance
# so that all water freezed into ice of infinite despair and hopelessness, when it comes in contact with the cold golden walls
# and in the most bottom center of the boat he built a little room out of gold of forgiveness from outside, mirrors of selflessness from inside and a little door of sharing
# and he sealed the door with holy seals of his spirit so that only those can go into the room who are like him
# and in the center of the room he drilled a hole through the bottom of the boat, to get ice from the outside
# and directly on the ice he made a fireplace where he burned down his wood of integrity into ashes of humility
# and due to the intense heat from the fire, that was multiplied through the reflection of the mirrors all around, the ice vaporized directly into thin air
# and together with the smoke of the burned wood of integrity, the air came out of the sealed door as a continous breath of life
# and the ashes of humility from the burned wood of integrity he put outside above and around his little room to build the soil within his boat
# then he sacrificed the only thing he behold for himself from the top center of his boat, his only begotten son of purity
# and replaced him with a mirror made out of selflessness and polished the it to perfect brilliance with the ashes of humility
# then he buried his only begotten son of purity into the ashes of humility as a seed
# and the seed growed to a giant tree in the center of his boat
# and the tree got it's water from the breath of life, that condensated wherever it got a little cold and gently settled down like morning dew of lovely caring and blessed the soil with purified moisture of gentle guidance
# and the tree got it's nutritions from the ashes of humility, to grow wood, leaves, blossoms and fruits for all to build whatever wanted, to shine in beauty however wanted, to bring to birth whatever wanted and to eat from whatever wanted
# and the weather go stormy and rainy again
# but this time the man said: "Sorry guys, I have to check the functionality first, so this time you have to help yourself until I'm back!"
# and many cried in fear and agony: "He is leaving us alone in the wilds?"
# but he said: "Trust me, the wooden boad will not stand the next storm, and when even this doesn't work, it's all gone anyway. But if you want to help me, just make plenty of sound, so that I can at least hear you. Because it's pretty dark down there."
# and then he entered his boat, went into the water, sunk down and was never seen again
# but one day, a giant golden boat, covered in ice fell from the sky out of nothing
# and it fell into the oceans and caused a giant tsunami, that blasted away all the waters and the land got secure again for a short time
# and then he opened the door of his insane submarine in an golden armor suit, that was covered with ice and icy clouds of despair run down from him
# he stepped out of his boat and said: "Hey, it's me and do you know what, it works! So come on and hop in, it's nice and warm in here. But don't waste time, because it will not take long and the blasted water will swap back again. And don't touch me while I'm outside here, or you will freeze to death."
# and so they all hopped in as quick as possible
# and as they stepped in, they became new bodys of pure heavenly behavior and looked like shiny gemstones, completely unable to sin against heaven in any way
# and with everyone who stepped in, the polished mirror on the top center of the boat became brighter and brighter and began to radiate pure love to everyone in the boat
# then the waters begin to swap back, he closed the door and locked it
# and the golden submarine, covered with ice began to dive through the waters for ever and ever and was never seen again
# but what the meaning of the fire is and where it comes from, that is a long story
