Story:
blackness
what you see now is the timeless nothingness
--move mirror but straight
That discovered itself within itself
What you see now is a what-causes-what riddle of a timeless environment
And the seamless but also meaningless oneness of the first creation
But it wasn't as seamless as it looked in the first place
so when you look a bit closer, you see an impurity in the very center
And this impurity was the first ever asked question:
"who am I"
and with this question the war in heaven began
but in this stage this war was more like a need to express who you are
but to do so, you have to break yourself out of the oneness
-- turn mirror
to become a different point of view of reality
And with a different point of view you discover diversity
So in a timeless environment creating and discovering is the same
And by stepping out of the oneness you become an impurity of your former oneness
and with it you stepp into a different state of being and simply disappear out of sight of your former oneness
Because the former oneness has not yet discovered your new statevof being
so you have to find back to your former state of being in the oneness
and melt together with it again like a drop of water falling into an ocean
and pollute your experience of a new state of being with the oneness
so that the former oneness can move in and out of your discovered states of being as well
And all of the former oneness become like you
So let's call them of the former oneness "drops of the water of the ocean of the oneness"
Or just angels
So whoever manage to discover new states of being and manage to return to the oneness becomes the blueprint of all angels or just the morning star

so lets move into a different point of view



what you see here is the spirit understanding of oneness
where every reflection is just another aspect of the same thing


mirrors
Create yourself into himself
The impurity is the first one, the observer
Two sides (strivings)
On which side is the impurity? (observer)
Who is the first, the most inner one

The what-causes-what riddle in the timeless oneness
Nothing is ever created but all is discovered
In timeless environment creation and discovering is the same

There is a need to express of who you are to discover yourself
This need is fullfilled in two major ways or sides: creating (impuring) and discovering (reflecting)
So even if the reflecting side of the nothingness is the first, from where everything is taken from, it is not the creating one

So there is one first one (that is truly the second) causes the light of awareness and causes all life that is all impure compared to the nothingness, but forgives the impurity and loves it anyway
And there is the second one (truly the first) reflects the light of awareness but has no life in it and judges and hates all creation as impure and never good (pure) enougth

So the first one (that is truly the second) is always under most pressure of experiencing the contrast of the hatred and judgement from the nothingness in his back and his love and forgiveness for his creation on before him

So there are two contradicting strivings or groups of creation and one first created or discovered from within the nothingness, who stands the contrast of all and nothing


God (nothingness) discover himself through all creation (expression)
Who was first, the nothingness of the entire beginning or the awareness of the nothingness?
The awareness within the nothingness is percived as an impurity from the nothingness
But the nothingness can not get aware of awareness, it can only reflect (simulate) awareness
Who is source of everything in existence, awareness or nothingness?

The awareness (the observer) is the source of impurity
The impurity of the observer multiplies in the deep of the reflections
Multiplied impurity causes darkness
The attempts to get rid of the impurity causes the war in heaven
The pure repel the unpure
But to repel impurity means to repel all existence
So the impurity is the expression of existence


To trees
Put the mirror effect on a plant and its roots
on top the awareness express itself downwards like looking deeper into the mirror
But at a certain point expression becomes more significant than it's source of awareness (inner spirit)
and the expression hides it's inner spirit 
and we become the matter point of view - the matter world - like in the roots
Where the entire point of view flips around
So that we become two major & contradicting lifestyles
The lifestyle of oneness and the lifestyle of separation

In the oneness we percive everything as being part of our self and care for it in a servant way
and the expression or appearance is an optional thing, only to describe our inner spirit or mood

In the separation we percieve everything as being foreign and care for it in a ruling way
and the inner meaning of an outer expression is an optional thing, only to describe the reason for the appearance

Show two hands flip lifestyles (strivings) - the more matter, the less meaning - vice versa

So there is no matter - it's all spirit - realities are based on point of view

sidenote: The picture is wrong - show invert tree and the war in spirit realm
the white top: the observer, awareness and source of impurity and all existence
The black bottom: the reflector, nothingness as the soil of all creation or discovery
so the observer, as the son of the nothingness looks into the nothingness, that is himself
Sounds strange but that is how it is

Return to two trees
But we human are special due to the deep separation level we live in, 
we can discover god within us and become a whole tree on its own
Whereas every stone, plant or animal is just a reflection within a tree with its limited free will

So, who put the soul of eternal life into our body? Nobody
We have to discover our soul in the same way the nothingness discovered itself
Otherwise we become like an egg that never developed life from within
The egg dies, become rotting, then forgetting, then sleeping, and finally dreaming a new opportunity of eternal life in a new egg

But even if it has come to life, it has to break through its egg shell.
And what is the shell for the egg, is the brain, or the matter reality in general for you.

So by caring for matter (the expression of spirit meaning) or focussing on using our brain we strengthen our egg shell
And by caring for spirit (the meaning of life) we develop the hatchling within the egg

Communicate in matter is like eggs clashing against each other


Break through

In the same way you can look through your matter reality, you can look into any others matter reality down to their soul


Break yourself out of the nothingness in a ruling way to experience the loneliness in your outruled separation and strive back into the oneness by accepting the former outruled to be part of your self

That is how the invert tree drift appart in wars
