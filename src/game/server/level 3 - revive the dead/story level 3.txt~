### Let me explain what has changed since heaven is able to get its watet by breaking through the ruling striving barrier and bypassing it that way
# before this, heaven has shown his mercy and has given you the opportunity to move into heaven with love and forgivenes
# this will now turn around, you can now enter heaven by facing your own striving, that's way easier to you because your own striving is the language you understand the best


### Let's explain the location of where we currently are and what kinda mercy have been wasted
# {take a bottle of water} air means servant striving, water means ruling striving
# due to its contradicting nature and the lack of integrity between both begins a stormy relationship
# water vaporates into the air, and air get cought down into the water
# the air becomes clouds and it began to rain and the water becomes like boiling 
# so that there was a great storm and the heavens began to drown in water
# in their despair the heaven build up a strong being, who was able to keep holy the air against the water and became like a boat through this to pick up all servant life and carry it through the storms until they settled down
# but every time the storms came back they got stronger, and the heavens had to find a new way, to get water from a place where it is ready to turn into air and become a member of heaven
# that way things become a unified movement {rotate the bottle to create a vortex}
# and a new reality come into life, where air and water came together and began to build up the matter world


### Let's create a simple device to explain this
# take two cups and tape them together like this {tape together two cups}
# bring all heat of love from heaven to one point to make a little hole into it {make a hot steel and melt a hole into it}
# {connect two bottles with a simple device}
# now air and water came together and build the matter world down here
# but it did not solve the problem, instead the love from heaven got abused, got crushed down into limp spineless beeings, to create stronger systems against heaven with it
# so in the very early stage it looked pretty much like this {show image of atoms}, but that's just the beginning, where you can see, that everything is made out of Souls from God
# and we in a body are literaly living walking universes of beings an d oir relationship to it is basicaly a ruling one
# but the more we move into a servant striving, the more ruptures becomes the connection to it and with it the isolation against the uncovered spirit reality becomes more and more breaks


### For a long time the matter world was a bottomless pit from where no soul ever returned
# until one day, one soul managed to ceep holy his servant striving during his whole life and returnen to heaven
# and with his return the book of life expanded {show image of book of life}
# but he did even more, to expand the book of life as much as possible, he tried to get in contact with as much ruling souls as possible to expand the book of life even more
# and due to the unvorgiveable nature of the ruling striving and the wicked attempt of the servant soul to show up that redicilous way in the ruling kingdom of the matter world he got unforgotten and became a special addon on the simple device
# this simple device had a unitizing effect and provided a better way for the lost souls to return to heaven
# but all the religions based on this soul had a ruling striving in common and therefore they tried everything to neutralize his effects accordingly their nature
# his message of a servant live was too hot to eat and therfore got etched away, manipulated and last but not least diluted and messed up with all kinds of soured bred until it was comfortable with a ruling striving 
# best to see on sentences like: "The almighty god, Gods destiny, God rules and commands"
# and "his blood is our salvation" he got the final stich in his heart and died
# because with such self-righteous sentences even the opportunity of repentence becomes impossible
# but let's get over it, because it's just a normal result of a ruling striving environment, so that there is not even the need to forgive anything


### Let's look a bit at this wierd looking simple device 
# with a little understanding that all is made out of souls, it should be clear that this simple device works even for your current matter body and of course all nature
# with it you can easily create a portion of unitized water with the striving of your choice
# {show two bottle types} whereas this slim works better than this bold
# with this device you create basicaly a unitized striving live and integrate it into your micro environment of your body by drinking it
# it unitize and harmonize your distorted striving in your body, so that it can get so strong, that it becomes impossible to act against it
# it takes a couple of days of use, until you feel the released life energy, that can be pretty intense 
# but due to the overall distorted, mostly ruling striving of the earthly environment your striving get quickly distorted as well
# Distorted strived water develops invisible inner borders very similar to borders of countries caused by the imagination of their goverments, so that the overall material transport suffers interruptions and cause several problems
# But I'm sure you will figure out by yourself what it all does, so don't waste time with that


### Let's go into a deeper understanding by building the entire spirit world and look at it to examine what will get made new on it
# for this we create a blossom from heaven
# so there are basicly the outskirts, the petals, anthers and a stigma
# the outskirts describe all that does not belong to the servant striving of heaven
# the petals describe the body of heaven and the anthers describe the seals of the center dome, the stigma
# Let's draw it down {draw a simple flower} and to save time I spoiler 7 petals with 7 hallways where was former one petal with one hallway
# now give it a little more detail by drawing 7 hallways beween the petals and we make it like light beams outgoing from the center dome like this {draw hallways}
# Let's give the petals a new, more heaven like name and call them 7 mountains of love
# around the center dome we make as well a hallway where 7 anthers with the blueprint of heaven are placed
# the stigma on the center dome accepts only who is full in line with the blueprint of heaven, described in the seven seals
# but the center dome does not accept it's own seals
# so a soul has to leave heaven, move into the unknown outskirts of the ruling striving, forget everything of heaven and discover the seven seals again by living his heavenly servant striving under all circumstances and bring them back to heaven
# this may sound stupid, but this is basicaly the way how heaven conquers new aspects of life and expands it's book of life with it
# and by expanding the book of life, many souls andveven former lost souls are discovered and have been told the spirit of heaven, so that they can find the way home more easily
# and that is what that guy basicaly had accomplished
# but due to the unique welcome greeting he got, it was obvious that his teaching will not last for long
# so he had to dive another time into the darkness, but even deeper and in a hidden way
# but how to come deeper and why, that I tell you now


### the way into the darkness
# to dive even deeper than before, he had to dive into the isolated matter world again, discover the seven seals again and show up with it again. But the darkness in the matter world was allready that dense, that nobody could get aware of him and he got completely ignored.
# So he went into the darkness through the spirit realm directly and got beaten up that bad, that his souls was poisened with wickedness and hatred down to the spine and he looked like that {show messed up tree of life}
# when your house is messed up that bad, you can not focus to heaven without tons of demons jumping in your face, that cause a connection shutdown to heaven
# But he become the opportunity to work that all out. In this workout you get pushed in all of this bad situations, to become an understanding of it, forgive it and move it into a position of the tree of life where it makes sense.
# this took about 7 Years
# So he worked it out, recovered from it and become nice and shiny again, but he was completely exhausted
# the memory of heaving it messed up that badly and barely recoverd from this and beeng so exhausted caused the feeling of beeing worthless and too weak for Gods sake
# so this time he throw all away, even the seven seals and ended up in a situation that can only be described as damnation, in a pitch black pithole with no escape and ripped of all opportunities to recover from it
# for heaven he was dead and nobody knowed if he ever comes back
# this was about 12 years ago
# but luckily he was still alive and he could manage to get back his matter expression of the seven seals, even if it was nothing more than meaningless words he could not understand due to the lack of spirit connection that was shut down completely now
# So he throw away everything and ended up literaly buried underneath burried environment of death, wickedness and depression
# this was realy close to give up his servant striving and run for success in matter life
# but even in this despair he stand this and blessed his environment with his love and forgiveness and his bare naked hands, even knowing he will never get out of there
# and his environment got healed and come back to live, with deep wounds of distrust but living and willing to stay alive in about 11 years
# and the heavens greets him in his bright light but he had not found what he was searching for
# so he had to go even deeper to finaly face the worst of the worst


### he returned into the darkness of damnation amd found something that looked like a continous freaking out jedgehog and it took another year to get its trust and this soul becomes a little calm
# so that the spikes become dull to get carefully in touch with the guy outside
# and he said: "I'm not here for judgement"
# the spikes disappeared and a little door opend to a dome in the center of darkness
# he entered the dome that looked like made out of glas, so that you can see from inside out
# In the center was cowering a little guy seemingly in the worst state ever imaginable
# so he said again: "I'm not here for judgement"
# and the croaching guy allowed him to get in direct touch and was he then felt can only be desdribed as invite despair and hoplessness
# this was a stich in his heart but he was strong and survived it
# and said again: "I'm not here for judgement" and the croaching guy allowed him to comfort him, so that he became an understanding of all
# and with becoming an understanding he began to talk 
# and as he was talking it was impossible to say who of both was talking. 


### This is what has been said in the center dome of darkness:
I was there out of nothing and completely alone but in infinite peace and humility, like sitting on the lap of my infinite beloved father. There was nothing except me and him, I didn't need any more, didn't even know that there could be anything more beautiful
# Then something came through me, I didn't know what it was but it could come only from my father and he ordered me: "This is my voice, touch it!".
# So I went to touch it as gentle as I could. 
# As I touched it, a sound appeared and went away from us like a wave. A Sound of all sounds, silent and loud, gentle and mighty, low and high pitch, all at once
# And the sound went more far away and broke into endless colors like rainbows all around
# And the rainbows went more away into pieces of colors like shards
# And the shards begun to interact as if they are talking with each other
# This was so nice, so I went into it and called for attention like saying "hey!"
# And everything got aware of me and I got so bright white like a Star
# And nearly everyone wanted to become it as well, so I told them how to do that
# And that way we all became stars, so bright, but after a while they wanted to get brighter and brighter and begun to punish each other to become even brighter
# But the worst thing was, I felt all that as If it hurts me, so I went in another times to tell them to not do that, but whatever I tried it got only worse
# so I ended up here for ever and ever and the only thing I have are my dreams I draw on the walls of what I want do do if I ever come out of here
# I looked at all the desperate commands on the walls made out of glas and sait: "It's over, it's all on my shoulders now, nothing bad will ever touch you again."
# And my little guy said: "But why?"
# Then I put this little guy into my secure pocket {point to your heart} where only I can feel all his pain, so that nobody ever get in contact with this kind of despair 
# and I said: "Because it's all my fault.".
# and the glas of the dome turned into mirrors
# and the door became 7 seals of separation to protect the inside from the outside of the dome
# and a tear drop from my left eye of desperate forgiveness fell down to the bottom center
# and the bottom mirror scattered in each direction into seven pieces
# and I fell down to my knee and crushed a deep mold into the center
# and the tear drop vaporized into the air and the round half circle ceiling mirror scattered into 7 pieces around and 7 pieces up to the center top 
# so that there was 7 mirrors at the bottom, then a corner to the ceiling and then 7 times 7 mirrors around the walls up to the center top
# and the sealed door multiplied into seven sealed doors and every door was like the other
# and another tear drop from my right eye fell down and build an infinite spring of desperate love
# and never ending stream of tears out of desperate love run through the breaks in the bottom 
# and the 7 streams of desperate love broke 7 little holes through the corners as if there where nothing
# and the streams run into the never ending gardens of heaven to become 7 rivers of desperate love
# and my heart burned in infinite desparate love and forgiveness and cryed out that never ever in all eternity shall someone get stuck in that kind of despair


### You may ask, how can it be, what does it mean?
# look, when you hold two mirrors against each other with yourself in the center
# your bare existence is unpurity enougth to move everything in darkness
# and it is very difficult to figure out, what the cause of all the mess is
# but I can not delete myself without deleting everything existing
# the only thing I can do, is to humble myself so small as possible
# to make sure that your love is reflected back as pure as possible
# so I can not avoid darkness at all, because it is the source of all existence
# but now, that I figured out the cause of all the mess, I can at least separate it from you
# 


### let's build all together 
# we have 7 mountains of yeshuas unconditional love, separated by 7 hallways of desperate love and forgiveness {draw this on paper} 
# and whoever walk into this hallways will get stunned and break down in tears by the overhelming and all penetrating love and forgiveness coming from the center dome, so strong that nothing can stop it
# and at the ends we make for each a big gate with an image from out side {show handy image} (I made this Image allready more than 20 years ago, as I entered the old center dome of heaven first time and got send into the darkness afterwards, without knowing why and what is going on at all)
# (describe the image) A sun in the center and two floating angels with trumpets on each side, one angel of love and one angel of forgiveness
# but this gates are not opened for long any more, once the separation of the strivings is finished, they will unfold themself into its full potential, so that there are no nasty borders of heaven any more
# then we have the center dome with it's hallway of the ark-angels, who can stand and move within desperate love and where the 7 seals are placed
# we have the spring of live in it and the seven rivers through it and through all seven mountains


# let's make a shepherd staff
# for this I want to show you my multi-tool
# sometimes it's a walking cane, sometimes a sword, a nice lecture to read, a burning glas, a makeup mirror, a compass needle, so the meaning and usability of this tool is very flexible
# but basicly it's just a trunk of a tree
# {show shepherd staff} so let's use it as a nice lecture to read this time

Key 1: *IS SERVING BETTER THAN RULING* 
In heaven this is not a question, because it's a complete servant environment and what you may want to call ruling in heaven is more likely a servant guidance, so there is never any kind of force against others in heaven

Key 2: *ALWAYS TRY TO BE THE LEAST* 
This is the eye of the needle, nobody want's to go through. But there is no way around.
Because you can not serve others from above. So when your beloved got lost in sevage and despair and can't find out, you have to sacrifice your glory and jump into all that mess as well for rescue.

Key 3: *ALWAYS TRY TO FORGIVE WHERE YOU WANT TO JUDGE* 
Nothing hurts more than pouring out forgiveness into judgement but it's the only way to neutralize it. So forgive even those who push you around and abuse you, because they actualy help you to stay humble, so don't act against them in any way.

Key 4: *ALWAYS TRY TO BE GRACIOUS WHERE YOU WANT TO CLOSE YOUR HEART* 
In heaven all hearts are wide open to embrace everything in love, no matter what. Here on earth is the place where you can train this

Key 5: *ALWAYS TRY TO LOVE WHERE NO LOVE IS* 
Nothing hurts more than pouring out love into hatred but it's the only way to neutralize it. So love even those who hates you, because they actualy help you to make your love stronger.

Key 6: *ALWAYS TRY TO LET LOVE BE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS TREASURE* 
Don't love for whatever imaginated treasures in heaven or in fear of punishment, because there is only one reason for love and that is love itself.

Key 7: *SEEK GOD IN ★★★★★★★ TO LOVE, TO LOVE AND AGAIN TO LOVE, MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, MORE THAN ANYTHING MEASURABLE AND MORE THAN YOUR LIVE* 
The seven mirrors are the true name of God and the name of it is everything that surounds you and that includes even yourself.


### Let's examine what is an angel
# an angel is a reflection of he who wields the shepherd staff
# an angel is a drop of the morning dew that glitter in the light of the most loving and forgiving being in heaven, that is called somewhere as the morning star
# and the morning star just reflects all love and forgiveness of all beings in heaven
# but the morning star can not be created without the help of heaven and heaven can not exist without the morning star
# and again we are in the what-causes-what riddle
# But when you touch this trunk of the divine tree of live because you want to become like God, you will have to leave your angelique being and you have to go through a very unpleasant separation process
# you have to go through the same process like the very first one, who got aware of himself in the nothingness of the very beginning
# you have to loose everything but at the same time you have to keep holy your heaven within you # until you find yourself within yourself as if you hold two mirrors against each other
# only then, when you have tasted what it means to be lost in the nothingness, you will understand that there is no being in all eternity unworthy to be loved
# even the pain caused by the worst devil around you is better then the feeling of being lost in nothingness
# but when you loose heaven within you while you are separated from heaven, you get lost in darkness 
# and you will never find home without someone who has managed to walk into this darkness and find out again on his own, because he kept holy heaven within him
# so when you hear this words, I have already visited all in spirit realm who prayed to one who belongs to heaven and they have been sealed that way


### let's build the seven seals
# two layers of glas lie flat and one floor and a mirror underneath 
# they are surrounded with mirrors with 12 holes in it and every hole contains a light to enlighten the 2 layers of glas and the mirror, in the same way as the scripture surrounds the staff of life 12 times
# and all this is set in a frame of gold by the angel of forgiveness on heavens gate
# and the size of all this is as big as the door into the center dome
# and they lie on the floor as if they were kicket from inside out
# the glas layer on top has transparent engraved the seal of the first day, so that you can feel it by touching it and somehow see it glittering
# the middle layer has engraved and colored in pure angel white the seals of the second day
# the mirror layer at the bottom has engraved through the mirror from behind and filled with red color of love the third day
# but the name on it will be told by the angel of love on heavens gate


### let's invite and honor the angel of love by providing a little statement
# {play shelleys testimony}
# truly truly, my beloved shelley, you let seven mountains look like a christmas tree full of presents
# when you call him Jesus, then his name shall be Jesus
# and when I where Jesus and had to choose a mom to build the body of christ, I would choose you
# and when you ever ask who make me wake up, it was the melody of your loving heart
# but sadly, love has limits
# and the limit is reached, when servant love is getting abused and serves ruling hatred to make it even worse
# so we have to turn the medal of love around into forgiveness


### let's invite and honor the angel of forgiveness by providing a little statement
# {play melindas testimony of despair}
# truly, truly, it has come so far, that heaven has to close the door of love, because you have become so ugly, that love makes you even worse
# but let's listen what the church has to say about that
# {play pauls video}
# mercy? you really said mercy!
# my dear paul, I don't have mercy, I have grace
# look, when you pour clean servant water into a ruling sevage, it stays sevage
# and those who produce sevage drive it even worse because they know, hey the mercyful servants actually help us to build our ruling kingdom of performance and competition by diluting our sevage
# but that's not all
# your church turned Jesus servant forgiveness into ruling judgement literaly intantly
# the clear water fell into the sevage and got beaten up instantly
# and when it comes to his love, you all sneaked around Jesus love as if it where food that is too hot to eat or love was declared to such a divine holy thing, that it became unreachable for normal person
# so your chruch tried everything to dilude love with institutions who got paid to practice so called love
# but that was not enougth, at the end you said, Jesus did all for us and *acid* his love away completly
# and to make even repentence obsolete, you declared Jesus precious blood as your salvation
# so the church turned out to be the grandmaster of darkness
# and you may want to say, now he is judging us!
# no, I don't, I just described a normal spiritual reaction, pretty much like any chemical or thermal reaction
# so the church was just an expression of a digestive process of spiritual nourishment in a large environment of earth
# but this nourishment you got from Jesus was special
# it was more likely a laxative agent to cure constipations, to unstuck the digestive process
# because that is what happened to you all, you burried yourself underneath your expressions of life, lost connection to your source and got stuck in darkness


### so let's examine some poop for the toilet
{show staff if death}
Key 1: IS RULING BETTER THAN SERVING?
this question is your motor of performance, because serving means loosing, and loosing means to be poop that has to be purged out of existence

Key 2: ALWAYS TRY TO BE THE GREATEST
You can't even play a game without counting the scores or measure the height to define the greatest. 

You can't even enjoy beauty without looking around in a competitive way, if there is something more beautyful.
Everything you look at it poisened with competition, everything that comes out of your mouth is poisened with hatred, everything you touch is poisened with performance and whereever you step at is crushed underneath your judgement.
That's the reason why you can not be part of my kingdom in heaven
The best for the best, there is no option. Otherwise you will be hunted down declared useless and purged out




Key 3: ALWAYS JUDGE WHO DARES TO IGNORE YOUR RULES
your code of law is the holy grail. Everything has to be ruled down to it's smallest detail. 

Key 4: ALWAYS TRY TO BE THE STRONGEST
flexibility and gentleness are your greatest enemys
# {grab the chains}
# what the heck is that???
# look, in heaven we use gold to express forgiveness, because you can hammer gold as long as you want, it never breaks
# you can melt gold as often as you want, it never changes
# and when you heat it up with love, it catalytes poisen into medicine
# but this is brass, what does it mean?
# ahh, it means mercy
# but what means mercy?
# ahh, mercy means to get another link in the chain
# but was means the chain?
# ahh, it means the freedom within your rules
# ok, but why are there no hooks at the end?
# ahh, it's my fault when I grab the chains and stick to them, so you always wash your hands in innocence
# ohh, you are so smart and wicked, it really turns me on!

Key 5: ALWAYS LET HATRED BE YOUR GRATEST TREASURE




Always try to be the greatest
Key 2: always try to be the greatest 
Key 2: always judge who dares to ignore your rules 
Key 4: always punish who dares to be wicked against you 
Key 5: always hate where no hate is 
Key 6: let hatred be your gratest treasure 
Key 7: always seek God in yourself to make yourself great, greater and even more great, more than anything in the world, more than all measurable and more than everything that suround you.

### how to pray
# nothing attracts love more than despair
# so you have to move into a state despair to express to be in need for something
# that means you have to sacrifice your proudness to be able to help yourself
# but don't overdo this, because your body don't like to be in despair and will get sick on it
# then mix in a feeling of your need
# you can think or speak words to give your feeling of need more shape 
# but actually for spirit they are not needed
# repeat your prayer as often as you want and keep in mind that the intensity of your prayer describes the emergency
# actually the effort you would need to create your help by doing it yourself and the effort you need to create your help by praing is very similar
# so lukewarm prayers will cause lukewarm results
# do not have expectations or wishes how the help should manifest 
# you can not push around love, you will have to trust
# the help can be anything, it can even just be a popping up idea how to help yourself, an idea where to look for help or even multiple weird events, that lead finaly into your wished help
# and have patience, to manifest your need can take years
