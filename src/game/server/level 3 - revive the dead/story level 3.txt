### Let me explain what has changed since heaven is able to get its watet by breaking through the ruling striving barrier and bypassing it that way
# before this, heaven has shown his mercy and has given you the opportunity to move into heaven with love and forgivenes
# this will now turn around, you can now enter heaven by facing your own striving, that's way easier to you because your own striving is the language you understand the best


### Let's explain the location of where we currently are and what kinda mercy have been wasted
# {take a bottle of water} air means servant striving, water means ruling striving
# due to its contradicting nature and the lack of integrity between both begins a stormy relationship
# water vaporates into the air, and air get cought down into the water
# the air becomes clouds and it began to rain and the water becomes like boiling 
# so that there was a great storm and the heavens began to drown in water
# in their despair the heaven build up a strong being, who was able to keep holy the air against the water and became like a boat through this to pick up all servant life and carry it through the storms until they settled down
# but every time the storms came back they got stronger, and the heavens had to find a new way, to get water from a place where it is ready to turn into air and become a member of heaven
# that way things become a unified movement {rotate the bottle to create a vortex}
# and a new reality come into life, where air and water came together and began to build up the matter world


### Let's create a simple device to explain this
# take two cups and tape them together like this {tape together two cups}
# bring all heat of love from heaven to one point to make a little hole into it {make a hot steel and melt a hole into it}
# {connect two bottles with a simple device}
# now air and water came together and build the matter world down here
# but it did not solve the problem, instead the love from heaven got abused, got crushed down into limp spineless beeings, to create stronger systems against heaven with it
# so in the very early stage it looked pretty much like this {show image of atoms}, but that's just the beginning, where you can see, that everything is made out of Souls from God
# and we in a body are literaly living walking universes of beings an d oir relationship to it is basicaly a ruling one
# but the more we move into a servant striving, the more ruptures becomes the connection to it and with it the isolation against the uncovered spirit reality becomes more and more breaks


### For a long time the matter world was a bottomless pit from where no soul ever returned
# until one day, one soul managed to ceep holy his servant striving during his whole life and returnen to heaven
# and with his return the book of life expanded {show image of book of life}
# but he did even more, to expand the book of life as much as possible, he tried to get in contact with as much ruling souls as possible to expand the book of life even more
# and due to the unvorgiveable nature of the ruling striving and the wicked attempt of the servant soul to show up that redicilous way in the ruling kingdom of the matter world he got unforgotten and became a special addon on the simple device
# this simple device had a unitizing effect and provided a better way for the lost souls to return to heaven
# but all the religions based on this soul had a ruling striving in common and therefore they tried everything to neutralize his effects accordingly their nature
# his message of a servant live was too hot to eat and therfore got etched away, manipulated and last but not least diluted and messed up with all kinds of soured bred until it was comfortable with a ruling striving 
# best to see on sentences like: "The almighty god, Gods destiny, God rules and commands"
# and "his blood is our salvation" he got the final stich in his heart and died
# because with such self-righteous sentences even the opportunity of repentence becomes impossible
# but let's get over it, because it's just a normal result of a ruling striving environment, so that there is not even the need to forgive anything


### Let's look a bit at this wierd looking simple device 
# with a little understanding that all is made out of souls, it should be clear that this simple device works even for your current matter body and of course all nature
# with it you can easily create a portion of unitized water with the striving of your choice
# {show two bottle types} whereas this slim works better than this bold
# with this device you create basicaly a unitized striving live and integrate it into your micro environment of your body by drinking it
# it unitize and harmonize your distorted striving in your body, so that it can get so strong, that it becomes impossible to act against it
# it takes a couple of days of use, until you feel the released life energy, that can be pretty intense 
# but due to the overall distorted, mostly ruling striving of the earthly environment your striving get quickly distorted as well
# Distorted strived water develops invisible inner borders very similar to borders of countries caused by the imagination of their goverments, so that the overall material transport suffers interruptions and cause several problems
# But I'm sure you will figure out by yourself what it all does, so don't waste time with that


### Let's go into a deeper understanding by building the entire spirit world and look at it to examine what will get made new on it
# for this we create a blossom from heaven
# so there are basicly the outskirts, the petals, anthers and a stigma
# the outskirts describe all that does not belong to the servant striving of heaven
# the petals describe the body of heaven and the anthers describe the seals of the center dome, the stigma
# Let's draw it down {draw a simple flower} and to save time I spoiler 7 petals with 7 hallways where was former one petal with one hallway
# now give it a little more detail by drawing 7 hallways beween the petals and we make it like light beams outgoing from the center dome like this {draw hallways}
# Let's give the petals a new, more heaven like name and call them 7 mountains of love
# around the center dome we make as well a hallway where 7 anthers with the blueprint of heaven are placed
# the stigma on the center dome accepts only who is full in line with the blueprint of heaven, described in the seven seals
# but the center dome does not accept it's own seals
# so a soul has to leave heaven, move into the unknown outskirts of the ruling striving, forget everything of heaven and discover the seven seals again by living his heavenly servant striving under all circumstances and bring them back to heaven
# this may sound stupid, but this is basicaly the way how heaven conquers new aspects of life and expands it's book of life with it
# and by expanding the book of life, many souls andveven former lost souls are discovered and have been told the spirit of heaven, so that they can find the way home more easily
# and that is what that guy basicaly had accomplished
# but due to the unique welcome greeting he got, it was obvious that his teaching will not last for long
# so he had to dive another time into the darkness, but even deeper and in a hidden way
# but how to come deeper and why, that I tell you now


### the way into the darkness
# to dive even deeper than before, he had to dive into the isolated matter world again, discover the seven seals again and show up with it again. But the darkness in the matter world was allready that dense, that nobody could get aware of him and he got completely ignored.
# So he went into the darkness through the spirit realm directly and got beaten up that bad, that his souls was poisened with wickedness and hatred down to the spine and he looked like that {show messed up tree of life}
# when your house is messed up that bad, you can not focus to heaven without tons of demons jumping in your face, that cause a connection shutdown to heaven
# But he become the opportunity to work that all out. In this workout you get pushed in all of this bad situations, to become an understanding of it, forgive it and move it into a position of the tree of life where it makes sense.
# this took about 7 Years
# So he worked it out, recovered from it and become nice and shiny again, but he was completely exhausted
# the memory of heaving it messed up that badly and barely recoverd from this and beeng so exhausted caused the feeling of beeing worthless and too weak for Gods sake
# so this time he throw all away, even the seven seals and ended up in a situation that can only be described as damnation, in a pitch black pithole with no escape and ripped of all opportunities to recover from it
# for heaven he was dead and nobody knowed if he ever comes back
# this was about 12 years ago
# but luckily he was still alive and he could manage to get back his matter expression of the seven seals, even if it was nothing more than meaningless words he could not understand due to the lack of spirit connection that was shut down completely now
# So he throw away everything and ended up literaly buried underneath burried environment of death, wickedness and depression
# this was realy close to give up his servant striving and run for success in matter life
# but even in this despair he stand this and blessed his environment with his love and forgiveness and his bare naked hands, even knowing he will never get out of there
# and his environment got healed and come back to live, with deep wounds of distrust but living and willing to stay alive in about 11 years
# and the heavens greets him in his bright light but he had not found what he was searching for
# so he had to go even deeper to finaly face the worst of the worst


### he returned into the darkness of damnation amd found something that looked like a continous freaking out jedgehog and it took another year to get its trust and this soul becomes a little calm
# so that the spikes become dull to get carefully in touch with the guy outside
# and he said: "I'm not here for judgement"
# the spikes disappeared and a little door opend to a dome in the center of darkness
# he entered the dome that looked like made out of glas, so that you can see from inside out
# In the center was cowering a little guy seemingly in the worst state ever imaginable
# so he said again: "I'm not here for judgement"
# and the croaching guy allowed him to get in direct touch and was he then felt can only be desdribed as invite despair and hoplessness
# this was a stich in his heart but he was strong and survived it
# and said again: "I'm not here for judgement" and the croaching guy allowed him to comfort him, so that he became an understanding of all
# and with becoming an understanding he began to talk 
# and as he was talking it was impossible to say who of both was talking. 


### This is what has been said in the center dome of darkness:
I was there out of nothing and completely alone but in infinite peace and humility, like sitting on the lap of my infinite beloved father. There was nothing except me and him, I didn't need any more, didn't even know that there could be anything more beautiful
# Then something came through me, I didn't know what it was but it could come only from my father and he ordered me: "This is my voice, touch it!".
# So I went to touch it as gentle as I could. 
# As I touched it, a sound appeared and went away from us like a wave. A Sound of all sounds, silent and loud, gentle and mighty, low and high pitch, all at once
# And the sound went more far away and broke into endless colors like rainbows all around
# And the rainbows went more away into pieces of colors like shards
# And the shards begun to interact as if they are talking with each other
# This was so nice, so I went into it and called for attention like saying "hey!"
# And everything got aware of me and I got so bright white like a Star
# And nearly everyone wanted to become it as well, so I told them how to do that
# And that way we all became stars, so bright, but after a while they wanted to get brighter and brighter and begun to punish each other to become even brighter
# But the worst thing was, I felt all that as If it hurts me, so I went in another times to tell them to not do that, but whatever I tried it got only worse
# so I ended up here for ever and ever and the only thing I have are my dreams I draw on the walls of what I want do do if I ever come out of here
# And I said "It's over, it's all on my shoulders now, nothing bad will ever touch you again."
# And my little guy said: "But you can not do that, nobody can bear that pain and forgive all that!"
# Then I put this little guy into my secure pocket {point to your heart} where only I can feel all his pain, so that nobody ever get in contact with this kind of despair 
# and I said: "It's allready done".
# and the glas of the dome turned into mirrors
# and the door became 7 seals to protect all who try to come into the dome
# And a tear drop from my left eye of unconditional forgiveness fell down to the bottom and it scattered into seven pieces and the tear drop vaporized into the air and the ceiling scattered into 77 pieces and the door multiplied into seven doors and every door was like the other. And another tear drop from my right eye fell down and build a spring of unconditional love
# and the water run through the breaks and 7 little holes in bottom of the ceiling to be a never ending source of life of heaven for ever and ever
# and a number did come into my mind, that all 14 gates of love are opened, all 4 directions of the book of life are revealed and all 3 days are without a mark
# and the meaning of this number is, that the book of life is completed and that there is no place any more, where someone can get lost for ever


### Let's look what just happened with some nice images
# {image transform (drill) book of life into a tree of life} here you see this guy moving from the center into outskirts to find the lost one
# and here you see like leaves all your prayers and drops of love and forgiveness, caring for his path to go
# and both together is the what-causes-what riddle
# so I don't know what you say, but I say a big thank you to you all, you are awesome, without you it were never been possible to stand all this
# thank you, thank you, thank you and a biiiig kiss to you all


### But now look what will change on a book of life
# {take book of life and scissors} let's take one and scissors to manipulate it
# we have here only 3 base colors, in heaven there are way more, gues how many, and every color express a meaning of life of heaven so that you can feel the colors when you look at it
# lets make some cuts
# turn the ends around and fix it {take a tacker and tacker a cross}
# now imagine this striving tool is in between here, where it is fixed together
# look, when we now cut this area of trouble here, so that both strivings can not get in touch any more, both sides can express their striving in full quality
# but one, this simply one in the middle {point to simple device}, has to stand all this
# one who is able to keep holy the spirit of heaven under all circumstances
# now the ruling striving is turned around against itself to produce plenty of souls in invinite despair who end up then directly on the bottom side of this simple device where they get easily get aligned into a servant striving and can enter heaven like fresh newborn souls
# to get an imagination, what this center dome radiates on heaven side, simply imagine the moment you move or travel from a state of infinite despair into a state of infinite love and an all embracing forgiveness, but cut off all the despair, and expand this moment into an everlasting blessing and in addition the reflection of all joy and bliss from all beings in heaven, that can get pretty intense depending on how close you get to it
# so if you think that is all to low for you, just enter the dome to get the full kick


### Let's show the staff of life in heaven from it's center dome, that contains as well the seven seals
# for that I have to go behind you, so let's go
# but don't touch it now, because the seals are not yet burned in
# {show staff of life}
# the tail first, where we explored the land
# now the body, where have climbed the mountain
# and finally the head, that contains the name of he who is like God


### Let's examine heavenly numbers
# well, there are no numbers in heaven, because every soul and everything that happens is unique and exist and happens only once, that makes every being and every moment in heaven infinite worthy
# therfore you can't count anything in heaven, even more, every time a soul enters heaven it is like two heavens merge together and doubles it's overall beauty and diversity
# however lets combine this staff and all our knowledge to get a better understanding of what all happend
# to become the opposide striving, we have to take the seven seals, cut of it's head, turn the rest upside down and replace the emptyness of our missing head with an artificial one, that is the entire matter world
# now we have the opposide of thevstaff if life, the staff of death, or anti-heaven, were all 3 days have only 6 seals to become the number 666 
# and the 7. seal is a hide to fake your true being
# however, we don't want to judge it away and  have to integrate it somehow
# to accomplish this we turn the staff of death around another times, but this time we turn it against itself {show turn your hand}
# then we bypass the artificial head, that means the entire matter world, as shown in the exercise on the second day 
# and put the staff of death as roots on the bottom of the staff of life to become this: {show the tree of life with complete staff of life}
# or this {put the book of life with light beam over it}


### let's build all together 
# we have 7 mountains here with 7 hallways {draw this on paper} and at the ends we make for each a big gate with an image from out side {show handy image}
# A sun in the center and two floating angels with trumpets on each side, one angel of love and amgel of forgiveness
# but this gates are not for long any more, once the separation of the strivings is finished, heaven will unfold itself into its full potential, so that there are no nasty borders of heaven any more
# and all who don't want to be part of the servant striving of heaven, can unfold their striving as well to their full potential and humble and rip off themself to the point of infinite despair, to be turned into the spirit of heaven
# then we have the center dome with it's hallway of 7 seals
# we have the spring of live in it and the seven rivers through it and through all seven mountains
# so there are two last things to do: build and place the seven seals and finish the staff of life


### let's build the seven seals
# two layers of glas lie flat and one floor and a mirror underneath 
# they are surrounded with mirrors with 12 holes in it and every hole contains a light to enlighten the 2 layers of glas and the mirror
# and all this is set in a frame of gold by the angel of forgiveness on heavens gate
# and the size of all this is as big as the door into the center dome
# and they lie on the floor as if they were kicket from inside out
# the glas layer on top has transparent engraved the seal of the first day, so that you can feel it by touching it and somehow see it glittering
# the middle layer has engraved and colored in pure angel white the seals of the second day
# the mirror layer at the bottom has engraved through the mirror from behind and filled with red color of love the third day
# but the name on it will be told by the angel of love on heavens gate


### let's look who the two whitnesses on heavens gate are
# for this we make a little free flight
# {take camera out of body} 
# you see this both whitnesses in gold here? they tell you what is required to pass the gates into heaven
# let the first one tell you what is meant with love {play shelleys video}
# oh my god, who was that? {pull out shelley} ah, it's shelley burkett sherill, from texas, deer park
# shelley, let me tell you, when you enter heaven, it will explode! You let seven mountains look like a christmas tree, full of joy and presents! Oh my god, I can not wait to give it to you!
# so, the beauty of heaven is love, but the soil where everything is build on is forgiveness
# but forgiveness you can not hear and you can not see, forgiveness is like pure nothingness
# and that is the reason why the other one becomes the seven seals and means my personal meaning of life
# let's look who won the first price 
# oh, it's melinda kay lions from alaska, anchorage, alias last frontier medium
# that really fits


### and to you, so called men, let me tell you, what your purpose is

# {fire on fire tool} holy crap, how hot the love is from just two woman
# the purpose of a man is integrity and that does not mean judgement, it does mean forgiveness, does mean to stand even the worst
# and when a woman has to step into the role of a man to survive
# then you have surpassed the meaning of a pathetic display
# 










### The meaning of 666
# look at the seven seals on the tree of life, cut of its head and put your own on it, turn all upside down, go with it for 3 days and at the end of the third day you will get your revard, the staff of death
# easy huh?!

### The meaning of 144000
# when all 14 gates of the 7 seals are opened over all 4 directions of the book of life and there is no mark on the 3 days, the number of 144000 is fulfilled
# easy as well huh?!
