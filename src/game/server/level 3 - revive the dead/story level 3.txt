### Let's explain the location of where we currently are
# {take a bottle of water} air means servant striving, water means ruling striving
# due to its contradicting nature and the lack of integrity between both a stormy relationship begins
# water vaporates into the air, and air get cought down into the water
# the air becomes clouds and it begin to rain and the water becomes like boiling 
# so that there develops a great storm and the heavens begin to drown in water
# in their despair the heaven build up a strong being, who was able to keep holy the air against the water 
# and became like a boat through this to pick up all servant life and settled down the storms that way
# but every time the storms came back they got stronger
# and the heavens had to find a new way, to get water from a place where it is ready to turn into air and become a member of heaven


### Let's create a simple device to explain this
# take two cups and tape them together like this {tape together two cups}
# now make a bottomless pit into it {make a hole in the two cups and connect two bottles with it}
# when this water drips through the hole it creates another isolation layer
# like a more complex body that shields the spirit from the global spirit environment
# but when we look into the next stage we see that it is just a repeat or a reflection of the situation we allready had before
# the only difference is the distance to it's source
# and to become an idea how often this already have been done, just look at the very early stages {show image of an atom}
# and every time we turn around the bottles for another chance it get only worse
# but one completely insane guy managed to move all the way down while keeping holy his servant striving and returned back to heaven
# that way he created a spirit tunnel {create a vortex in the bottel}
# but through the tunnel all the knowledge from heaven came into this deep isolation also
# and increased the development of even more isolated bodys rapidly
# this new bodys will not be based on water any more because the isolation is going to break
# the new bodys will be based on fire
# so we have to create a complete new tunnel into a state of being that have all separation layers in common
# that way we create a tunnel that works on all stages no matter how deep it will ever get


### let's enhance this simple device with a peacemaker
# we in a body are literaly living walking universes of beings
# and our relationship to it is basicaly a ruling one
# and we are isolated in our body through an unbelievable amount of matter layers
# and the only gap we have left to reconnect with spirit is water
# so water is the only element that reacts on spirit because it is made out of the most early separation layers
# but for that the water has to be pure and undistorted
# otherwise the spirit influence behaves like looking through a violent water surface
# and everything we percive is completely messed up
# to make it worse, distorted water does not move free anymore, become hard and sticky and cause several diseases {show the marbel machine demagnetizer video}
# so in ancient times the protection through the magnetic field was enougth
# and dirtortions came basically from the food we eat
# but in our modern times with all the electronics and radiations we are bypassing the natural protection shield from earth
# so that the main distortions come from the water itself today, especialy in citys and fasting becomes nearly useless that way
# to compensate this and enforce the natural magnetic field, we add some magnets around the vortex, where it rotates the fastest
# so just add them anyhow to the simple device {show simple device with peacemaker}
# magnets you find everywhere today, like in bicycle dynamos, hard drives, magnetic pins for notes or even in door seals from old fridges for example
# use this now about ten times and drink as much as possible at once to literaly flood your body with purified water
# but when you create purified water, you should contemplate a servant striving or state of being into it
# you do it just by looking at it while being in a very intense state of being you want to have in the water
# so don't be lukewarm and learn to move into powerful states of being on will even when there is strong influence from whatever source
# and when you are very sensitive allready you should sense a response like a reflection of your state of being coming from the water
# and the first effects after a view days will be a very enhanced life energy 
# and a very enhanced vision into the global spirit realm of your striving or state of being you contemplated into the water
# and it can become that strong that you become completely unable to sin against what you have contemplated into it
# but due to it's strong effects to your brain you may become intense headache or feeling like under electricity power first times
# and due to the better flow of purified water old muskle tensions can release, that can be very painful first


### let's make a note to not be confused
# I tell you all this retrospectively 
# and I try to tell you all that as comfortable as possible
# but at the time all that happened I had no clue what is going on
# and it was all but comfortable
# and the walk into the darkness was all made by my own mistakes
# but every time I walked into such mistakes I was like hypnotized 
# and that made it even worse to figure out why I acted like that
# but today I know why all this has to be done complete blind
# the state of being in second death had to be genuine, otherwise it would be worthless
# you have no idea what it means to stumble into the darkness with the knowledge of heaven in your heart
# so when someone say it's better you never have been born, it's not like that, it's even worse than that
# modern psychics say you can not cry longer than 30 minutes in a row
# but that is not true
# being trapped in pitch black darkness knowing the heaven you have messed up, you can cry forever and continously
# and the pain consumes your complete soul and all of your heart and it never stops
# and it is not the body pain you have, it's your whole soul that screems continously in unbearable pain of the lost, of what you have messed up
# but it is the only way to reach the state of all who are lost there also
# but never found out a way to recover from it


### let's create plenty of sourdough and get raped with evil spirit
# for this we need a body {take a bowl}
# and put purified water of life into it
# and some white flour and mix it
# now we have a blank new heavenly being
# add some honey of heavenly life experiences to it
# and we have an experienced heavenly being
# now we take our cleaning rag and clean up our kitchen and all tools we used with it
# and become a dirty rag that we kneat with some water
# now we squish some drops of the dirty water into the experienced heavenly being
# and become a heavenly being that was raped by evil
# so if you ever wonder how a woman feels that as raped by a man, that's exactly it


# first we need to purify our water to get a really good vision into the spirit world and don't miss any evil spirit we want to get poisened with
# then add some white flour of heavenly spirit as loot 



### let's create some sourdough
# for this we need a body {take a bowl}
# and put purified water of life with some white flour heavenly spirit into it and mix it
# now we have a blank new heavenly being
# and adding some honey of heavenly life experiences to it we become an experienced heavenly being
# now we take our cleaning rag and clean up our kitchen and all tools we used with it
# and become a dirty rag of spirit expressions that we knead with some water of life
# and drop some of this dirty water into the experienced heavenly being
# but the drops of dirty water and the sourdough are not well mixed so that there are hard and painful borders
# but we can smooth them with playful movement or hard work and stir our sourdough
# now our sourdough develops acid of performance and competition
# but we can compensate it by adding some more white flour of heavenly spirit and stir it again
# but the sourdough becomes too dense and begin to loose contact to spirit due to lack of water
# but we know how to get purified water of our striving
# so we can do this on and on and become a really massive sourdough that way with plenty of integrity
# and this sourdough represents our house that is our soul
# and by getting in contact with sourdough from other houses we enrich our diversity
# and with it we expand our book of life
# and when we eat some raw sourdough, we restore our gut flora in an instant
# so that our food processing keeps working like a charm
# and extracts all the diversity of nutritions to keep our matter body healthy


### let's get in direct spirit contact
# while our awareness is fixed to our brain our spirit contact is very limited
# and we have literally zero direct spirit contact with others
# so when our matter body get harmed, it may be very painful but it does not affect our spirit or our sourdough
# but when we get in  direct contact in spirit it is like two sourdough mix together
# and that can be very painful especially when the spirits are very different
# and it can take up to years until this contact is rendered in our brain somehow
# but when you have a well developed spirit connection
# and your brain is well trained in rendering spirit experiences
# you can render spirit nearly instantly into matter expressions


### let's get raped with all evil spirits on earth at once
# I don't want to tell you what you have to do to come into a situation that makes that possible
# so let's reduce it to a description how it looks like and how it feels
# imagine a strong hurricane of pure panic, violence, wickedness but no hatred, it's already all beyond hatred
# now imagine an ocean where every drop of water is such a hurricane
# and now jump into it
# it doesn't matter how long it was, your sourdough is infected in a blink of an eye
# you are complete poisoned with all evil spirit you can imagine
# and you prior beautiful house {show bright book of life} looks now like this {show raped book of life}
# and all your heavenly spirit connection is completely messed up and basically shut down and useless
# so if you ever wonder how a raped woman feels like, it's something like that
# and you will have to work this out with plenty of movement
# and you will become complete acid on this like hyperactive and like in permanent panic
# and you can work this out and complete your book of life into it's full range like that {show full book of life}
# but the question is, can you handle that and move through all states and strivings freely?


### let's move even deeper into pitch black damnation and get buried underneath depression and wickedness
# It's too bad to describe how that feels and how that looks like
# and it's again not the matter situation
# it's the spirit of heaven you have messed up so badly and burns buried deep in your hart in unbearable pain
# the only thing left over is your servant striving
# but being servant in such a situation heats up your buried heart even more
# and increase the pain to a level where you are continuously on the brink to faint and black out
# and there was many times I was on the brink to move into ruling but I didn't
# the surrounding depressions sucked up all my water of life
# and the acid of performance and competition burned even stronger
# but due to the life sucking depressions all around I could burn down my integrity in the fire of repentance
# and the alkaline of piece in the ashes of humiliation neutralized the acid
# and the ashes of humiliation neutralized all ruling spirits
# and the minerals in the ashes gave plenty of life experiences
# and after many years of pain I recovered, came back into movement
# and finally remembered how to make purified water
# and as I drunk the first portions of this water over a view days heaven came back
# and greeted me in an all flooding light
# but there was one thing I did not found in that deep pit of damnation
# so I had to go back into that state of being
# but that should not be a problem any more


### let's meet the worst of the worst in the center dome of darkness
# so I returned into the darkness of damnation
# and found something that looked like a continuous freaking out hedgehog
# and it took another year to get its trust and this poor soul becomes a little calm
# so that the spikes become dull to get carefully in touch with the me on the outside
# and I said: "I'm not here for judgement"
# the spikes disappeared and a little door opened to the center dome of darkness
# I entered the dome that looked like made out of glass, so that you can see from inside out
# and countless dreams of hope was written on the walls
# but they was all written in a ruling language
# and the sensation of me and you became weird blurry while in that dome
# and in the center was cowering a little soul on the ground, seemingly in the worst state ever imaginable
# so I said again: "I'm not here for judgement"
# and the poor crouching soul allowed me to get in direct touch
# well, after all what I have experienced, this let my heart scatter into empty meaningless pieces
# I got in touch with a state despair and hopelessness driven to infinity
# and I fell down to my knees in unbearable pain
# it was even worse than all evil together I got in touch with
# it was a state of second death when it can not get worse any more
# and it was the state of being before all creation, trapped in your own nothingness
# and I said again: "I'm not here for judgement"
# and the crouching soul allowed me to comfort him, so that he became peace and understanding of all
# and with becoming an understanding he began to talk
# and as he was talking it was impossible to say who was talking with who
# because the sensation of you and me seem to completely dissolve in this dome


### let's listen to the conversation in the center dome of darkness (part 1)
# I was there out of nothing and completely alone
# but in infinite peace and humility
# like sitting on the lap of my infinite beloved father
# there was nothing except me and him, I didn't need any more
# I didn't even know that there could be anything more beautiful then just being there in infinite peace and comfort
# Then something came through me, I didn't know what it was
# but it could come only from my father
# therefore it could only be good: "This is my voice, touch it!"
# so I went to touch it as gentle as I could
# and as I touched it, a sound of all sounds appeared and went away from us like a wave
# silent and loud, gentle and mighty, low and high pitch, all at once
# and the sound went more far away and broke into endless colors like rainbows all around
# and the rainbows went more away into pieces of colors like shards
# And the shards began to interact as if they are talking with each other
# this was all so nice, so I went into it and called for attention like saying "hey!"
# and everything got aware of me and I got so bright white like a Star
# and nearly everyone wanted to become it as well, so I told them how to do that
# and that way we all became stars, so bright, but after a while they wanted to get brighter
# and brighter and began to punish each other to become even brighter
# and I felt all that as If it hurts me
# so I went in another times to tell them to not do that
# but whatever I tried it got only worse
# so I ended up here for ever and ever
# and the only thing I have are my dreams I draw on the walls of what I want to do if I ever come out of here


### let's listen to the conversation in the center dome of darkness (part 2)
# and I began to understand
# and I asked this little poor soul: "can you please forgive me?"
# and this little soul asked: "forgive you, for what?"
# and I said: "because it's all my fault"
# and this little soul asked: "is it you?"
# and one little shard of my scattered heart became a colorful meaning again
# and the glass of the dome turned into mirrors to the inside
# and the door became 7 seals to protect the inside from the outside of the dome
# and a tear drop from my left eye of desperate love fell down to the bottom center
# and the bottom mirror scattered in each direction into seven pieces
# and the tear drop vaporized into the air
# and the round half circle ceiling mirror scattered into 7 pieces around and 7 pieces up to the center top
# so that there was 7 mirrors at the bottom
# then a corner to the ceiling
# and then 7 times 7 mirrors around the walls up to the center top
# and the sealed door multiplied into seven sealed doors and every door was like the other
# and an endless steam of desperate love blew threw the doors 7 fold over heavens 7 mountains of love
# and another tear drop of desperate forgiveness fell from my right eye
# and build a never ending stream of of desperate forgiveness to run through the breaks in the bottom
# and the 7 streams of desperate forgiveness broke 7 little holes through the corners of the ceiling as if there where nothing
# and the streams run into the never ending gardens of heaven to become 7 rivers of desperate forgiveness
# and my heart burned in infinite desperate love and forgiveness and cried out
# that never ever in all eternity shall someone get stuck in that kind of despair and hopelessness

# now air and water came together and build the matter world down here
# but it did not solve the problem, instead the love from heaven got abused, got crushed down into limp spineless beeings, to create stronger systems against heaven with it
# so in the very early stage it looked pretty much like this {show image of atoms}
# but that's just the beginning, where you can see, that everything is made out of Souls from God
# and we in a body are literaly living walking universes of beings
# and our relationship to it is basicaly a ruling one
# and we are isolated in our body through an unbelievable amount of matter layers
# and the only gap we have left to reconnect with spirit is water
# so water is the only element that reacts on spirit
# but for that the water has to be pure and undistorted
# in ancient times most of the distortions was coming through the food we eat
# so that fasting was very effective
# but in our modern times with all the electronics and radiations we have made useless the magnetic shield that protects us from external radiations
# and made spirit life in water on earth possible
# so the main distortion comes from the water itself today
# and how to make pure and undistorted water, to become clear vision into spirit again
# combined with all the exercises we have learned up to now
# that is what we are going to do now
# perhaps you have allready noticed, that you have a better spirit connection outside than inside houses
# this is because the very sensitive materialisation process of spirit into water is not that much distorted through all the radiating electronics in there


### Let's go into a deeper understanding by building the entire spirit world and look at it to examine what will get made new on it
# for this we create a blossom from heaven
# so there are basicly the outskirts, the petals, anthers and a stigma
# the outskirts describe all that does not belong to the servant striving of heaven
# the petals describe the body of heaven and the anthers describe the seals of the center dome, the stigma
# Let's draw it down {draw a simple flower} and to save time I spoiler 7 petals with 7 hallways where was former one petal with one hallway
# now give it a little more detail by drawing 7 hallways beween the petals and we make it like light beams outgoing from the center dome like this {draw hallways}
# Let's give the petals a new, more heaven like name and call them 7 mountains of love
# around the center dome we make as well a hallway where 7 anthers with the blueprint of heaven are placed
# the stigma on the center dome accepts only who is full in line with the blueprint of heaven, described in the seven seals
# but the center dome does not accept it's own seals
# so a soul has to leave heaven, move into the unknown outskirts of the ruling striving, forget everything of heaven and discover the seven seals again by living his heavenly servant striving under all circumstances and bring them back to heaven
# this may sound stupid, but this is basicaly the way how heaven conquers new aspects of life and expands it's book of life with it
# and by expanding the book of life, many souls andveven former lost souls are discovered and have been told the spirit of heaven, so that they can find the way home more easily
# and that is what that guy basicaly had accomplished
# but due to the unique welcome greeting he got, it was obvious that his teaching will not last for long
# so he had to dive another time into the darkness, but even deeper and in a hidden way
# but how to come deeper and why, that I tell you now


### the way into the darkness
# to dive even deeper than before, he had to dive into the isolated matter world again, discover the seven seals again and show up with it again. But the darkness in the matter world was allready that dense, that nobody could get aware of him and he got completely ignored.
# So he went into the darkness through the spirit realm directly and got beaten up that bad, that his souls was poisened with wickedness and hatred down to the spine and he looked like that {show messed up tree of life}
# when your house is messed up that bad, you can not focus to heaven without tons of demons jumping in your face, that cause a connection shutdown to heaven
# But he become the opportunity to work that all out. In this workout you get pushed in all of this bad situations, to become an understanding of it, forgive it and move it into a position of the tree of life where it makes sense.
# this took about 7 Years
# So he worked it out, recovered from it and become nice and shiny again, but he was completely exhausted
# the memory of heaving it messed up that badly and barely recoverd from this and beeng so exhausted caused the feeling of beeing worthless and too weak for Gods sake
# so this time he throw all away, even the seven seals and ended up in a situation that can only be described as damnation, in a pitch black pithole with no escape and ripped of all opportunities to recover from it
# for heaven he was dead and nobody knowed if he ever comes back
# this was about 12 years ago
# but luckily he was still alive and he could manage to get back his matter expression of the seven seals, even if it was nothing more than meaningless words he could not understand due to the lack of spirit connection that was shut down completely now
# So he throw away everything and ended up literaly buried underneath burried environment of death, wickedness and depression
# this was realy close to give up his servant striving and run for success in matter life
# but even in this despair he stand this and blessed his environment with his love and forgiveness and his bare naked hands, even knowing he will never get out of there
# and his environment got healed and come back to live, with deep wounds of distrust but living and willing to stay alive in about 11 years
# and the heavens greets him in his bright light but he had not found what he was searching for
# so he had to go even deeper to finaly face the worst of the worst


### he returned into the darkness of damnation amd found something that looked like a continous freaking out jedgehog and it took another year to get its trust and this soul becomes a little calm
# so that the spikes become dull to get carefully in touch with the guy outside
# and he said: "I'm not here for judgement"
# the spikes disappeared and a little door opend to a dome in the center of darkness
# he entered the dome that looked like made out of glas, so that you can see from inside out
# In the center was cowering a little guy seemingly in the worst state ever imaginable
# so he said again: "I'm not here for judgement"
# and the croaching guy allowed him to get in direct touch and was he then felt can only be desdribed as invite despair and hoplessness
# this was a stich in his heart but he was strong and survived it
# and said again: "I'm not here for judgement" and the croaching guy allowed him to comfort him, so that he became an understanding of all
# and with becoming an understanding he began to talk 
# and as he was talking it was impossible to say who of both was talking. 


### This is what has been said in the center dome of darkness:
I was there out of nothing and completely alone but in infinite peace and humility, like sitting on the lap of my infinite beloved father. There was nothing except me and him, I didn't need any more, didn't even know that there could be anything more beautiful
# Then something came through me, I didn't know what it was but it could come only from my father and he ordered me: "This is my voice, touch it!".
# So I went to touch it as gentle as I could. 
# As I touched it, a sound appeared and went away from us like a wave. A Sound of all sounds, silent and loud, gentle and mighty, low and high pitch, all at once
# And the sound went more far away and broke into endless colors like rainbows all around
# And the rainbows went more away into pieces of colors like shards
# And the shards begun to interact as if they are talking with each other
# This was so nice, so I went into it and called for attention like saying "hey!"
# And everything got aware of me and I got so bright white like a Star
# And nearly everyone wanted to become it as well, so I told them how to do that
# And that way we all became stars, so bright, but after a while they wanted to get brighter and brighter and begun to punish each other to become even brighter
# But the worst thing was, I felt all that as If it hurts me, so I went in another times to tell them to not do that, but whatever I tried it got only worse
# so I ended up here for ever and ever and the only thing I have are my dreams I draw on the walls of what I want do do if I ever come out of here
# I looked at all the desperate commands on the walls made out of glas and sait: "It's over, it's all on my shoulders now, nothing bad will ever touch you again."
# And my little guy said: "But why?"
# Then I put this little guy into my secure pocket {point to your heart} where only I can feel all his pain, so that nobody ever get in contact with this kind of despair 
# and I said: "Because it's all my fault.".
# and the glas of the dome turned into mirrors
# and the door became 7 seals of separation to protect the inside from the outside of the dome
# and a tear drop from my left eye of desperate forgiveness fell down to the bottom center
# and the bottom mirror scattered in each direction into seven pieces
# and I fell down to my knee and crushed a deep mold into the center
# and the tear drop vaporized into the air and the round half circle ceiling mirror scattered into 7 pieces around and 7 pieces up to the center top 
# so that there was 7 mirrors at the bottom, then a corner to the ceiling and then 7 times 7 mirrors around the walls up to the center top
# and the sealed door multiplied into seven sealed doors and every door was like the other
# and another tear drop from my right eye fell down and build an infinite spring of desperate love
# and never ending stream of tears out of desperate love run through the breaks in the bottom 
# and the 7 streams of desperate love broke 7 little holes through the corners as if there where nothing
# and the streams run into the never ending gardens of heaven to become 7 rivers of desperate love
# and my heart burned in infinite desparate love and forgiveness and cryed out that never ever in all eternity shall someone get stuck in that kind of despair


### You may ask, how can it be, what does it mean?
# look, when you hold two mirrors against each other with yourself in the center
# your bare existence is unpurity enougth to move everything in darkness
# and it is very difficult to figure out, what the cause of all the mess is
# but I can not delete myself without deleting everything existing
# the only thing I can do, is to humble myself so small as possible
# to make sure that your love is reflected back as pure as possible
# so I can not avoid darkness at all, because it is the source of all existence
# but now, that I figured out the cause of all the mess, I can at least separate it from you


### so let's look how to do that and build all together in a new way
# we have 7 mountains of yeshuas unconditional love, separated by 7 hallways of desperate love and forgiveness {draw this on paper} 
# and whoever walk into this hallways will get stunned and break down in tears by the overhelming and all penetrating love and forgiveness coming from the center dome, so strong that nothing can stop it
# and at the ends we make for each a big gate with an image from out side {show handy image} (I made this Image allready more than 20 years ago, as I entered the old center dome of heaven first time and got send into the darkness afterwards, without knowing why and what is going on at all)
# (describe the image) A sun in the center and two floating angels with trumpets on each side, one angel of love and one angel of forgiveness
# but this gates are not opened for long any more, once the separation of the strivings is finished, they will unfold themself into its full potential, so that there are no nasty borders of heaven any more
# then we have the center dome with it's hallway of the ark-angels, who can stand and move within desperate love and where the 7 seals are placed
# we have the spring of live in it and the seven rivers through it and through all seven mountains


# let's make a shepherd staff
# for this I want to show you my multi-tool
# sometimes it's a walking cane, sometimes a sword, a nice lecture to read, a burning glas, a makeup mirror, a compass needle, so the meaning and usability of this tool is very flexible
# but basicly it's just a trunk of a tree
# {show shepherd staff} so let's use it as a nice lecture to read this time

Key 1: *IS SERVING BETTER THAN RULING* 
In heaven this is not a question, because it's a complete servant environment and what you may want to call ruling in heaven is more likely a servant guidance, so there is never any kind of force against others in heaven

Key 2: *ALWAYS TRY TO BE THE LEAST* 
This is the eye of the needle, nobody want's to go through. But there is no way around.
Because you can not serve others from above. So when your beloved got lost in sevage and despair and can't find out, you have to sacrifice your glory and jump into all that mess as well for rescue.

Key 3: *ALWAYS TRY TO FORGIVE WHERE YOU WANT TO JUDGE* 
Nothing hurts more than pouring out forgiveness into judgement but it's the only way to neutralize it. So forgive even those who push you around and abuse you, because they actualy help you to stay humble, so don't act against them in any way.

Key 4: *ALWAYS TRY TO BE GRACIOUS WHERE YOU WANT TO CLOSE YOUR HEART* 
In heaven all hearts are wide open to embrace everything in love, no matter what. Here on earth is the place where you can train this

Key 5: *ALWAYS TRY TO LOVE WHERE NO LOVE IS* 
Nothing hurts more than pouring out love into hatred but it's the only way to neutralize it. So love even those who hates you, because they actualy help you to make your love stronger.

Key 6: *ALWAYS TRY TO LET LOVE BE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS TREASURE* 
Don't love for whatever imaginated treasures in heaven or in fear of punishment, because there is only one reason for love and that is love itself.

Key 7: *SEEK GOD IN ★★★★★★★ TO LOVE, TO LOVE AND AGAIN TO LOVE, MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, MORE THAN ANYTHING MEASURABLE AND MORE THAN YOUR LIVE* 
The seven mirrors are the true name of God and the name of it is everything that surounds you and that includes even yourself.


 
### that all we need in heaven 
# this seven seals a the notes of the music, the base colors and base behaviors 
# everyone in heaven play this notes in his own way fully free 
# and you can play them like you want 
# it always sounds beautyful 
# it always looks beautyful 
# and it always behaves beautiful 


### let's build the seven seals
# two layers of glas lie flat and one floor and a mirror underneath 
# they are surrounded with mirrors with 12 holes in it and every hole contains a light to enlighten the 2 layers of glas and the mirror, in the same way as the scripture surrounds the staff of life 12 times
# and all this is set in a frame of gold by the angel of forgiveness on heavens gate
# and the size of all this is as big as the door into the center dome
# and they lie on the floor as if they were kicket from inside out
# the glas layer on top has transparent engraved the seal of the first day, so that you can feel it by touching it and somehow see it glittering
# the middle layer has engraved and colored in pure angel white the seals of the second day
# the mirror layer at the bottom has engraved through the mirror from behind and filled with red color of love the third day
# but the name on it will be told by the angel of love on heavens gate


### let's invite and honor the angel of love by providing a little statement
# {play shelleys testimony}
# truly truly, my beloved shelley, you let seven mountains look like a christmas tree full of presents
# when you call him Jesus, then his name shall be Jesus
# and when I where Jesus and had to choose a mom to build the body of christ, I would choose you
# and when you ever ask who make me wake up, it was the melody of your loving heart
# but sadly, love has limits
# and the limit is reached, when servant love is getting abused and serves ruling hatred to make it even worse
# so we have to turn the medal of love around into forgiveness


### let's invite and honor the angel of forgiveness by providing a little statement
# {play melindas testimony of despair}
# truly, truly, it has come so far, that heaven has to close the door of love, because you have become so ugly, that love makes you even worse
# but let's listen what the church has to say about that
# {play pauls video}
# mercy? you really said mercy!
# my dear paul, I don't have mercy, I have grace
# look, when you pour clean servant water into a ruling sevage, it stays sevage
# and those who produce sevage drive it even worse because they know, hey the mercyful servants actually help us to build our ruling kingdom of performance and competition by diluting our sevage
# but that's not all
# the clear water fell into the sevage and got beaten up instantly
# and when it comes to his love, you all sneaked around Jesus love as if it where food that is too hot to eat # or love was declared to such a divine holy thing, that it became unreachable for normal person
# so your chruch tried everything to dilude love with institutions who got paid to practice so called love
# but that was not enougth, at the end you said, Jesus did all for us and *acid* his love away completly
# and to make even repentence obsolete, you declared Jesus precious blood as your salvation
# so the church turned out to be the grandmaster of darkness
# and you may want to say, now he is judging us!
# no, I don't, I just described a normal spiritual reaction, pretty much like any chemical or thermal reaction
# so the church was just an expression of a digestive process of spiritual nourishment into a large environment of earth 
# so the churches did exactly as they should, thank you for that 
# {show image of light beam} look, this is what happened 
# here is the light moving into your sevage 
# {move mask} and what you see here around the light beam are all your prayers, all your love and all your fights against darkness 
# so without you this all where not be possible 
# even more, we have a classic spiritual what-causes-what riddle 



### so let's figure out, what it meant with 3 days of darkness 
{show staff if death}
--- day 1 - explore the lands 
Key 1: IS RULING BETTER THAN SERVING? 
# this question is your motor of performance, because serving means loosing, and loosing means to be worthless poop that has to be purged out of existence 
 
 
--- day 2 - climb the bottomless pit 
Key 2: ALWAYS TRY TO BE THE GREATEST 
# You can't even play a game without counting the scores or measure the height to define the greatest.  
# You can't even enjoy beauty without looking around in a competitive way, if there is something more beautyful. 
# everything you look at it poisened with competition 
# everything that comes out of your mouth is poisened with hatred 
# everything you touch is poisened with performance  
# and whereever you step at has to be crushed underneath your judgement 
# That's the reason why you can't be part of my kingdom in heaven 
# you can't even find it because it's an absolute misery for you - thank God! 
 
 
Key 3: ALWAYS JUDGE WHO DARES TO IGNORE YOUR RULES 
# the book of your code of law is your holy bibel 
# everything has to be ruled down to it's smallest detail 
# everything that doesn't follow your rules is a system failure and has to be purged out. 
 

Key 4: ALWAYS TRY TO BE THE STRONGEST 
# flexibility and gentleness are your greatest enemys 
# {grab the chains} 
# {grab the chains} 
# what the heck is that??? 
# look, in heaven we use gold to express forgiveness, because you can hammer gold as long as you want, it never breaks 
# you can melt gold as often as you want, it never changes 
# and when you heat it up with love, it catalytes poisen into medicine 
# but this is brass, what does it mean? 
# ahh, it means mercy 
# but what means mercy? 
# ahh, mercy means to get another link in the chain 
# but was means the chain? 
# ahh, it means the freedom within your rules 
# ok, but why are there no hooks at the end? 
# ahh, it's my fault when I grab the chains and stick to them, so you always wash your hands in innocence 
# ohh, you are so smart and wicked, it really turns me on! 


Key 5: ALWAYS HATE WHERE NO HATE IS 
# {grab the hidden knifes} 
# with love it is the same as with hatred 
# it only shows up when it's needed, so let's look what shows up 
# shelly, when you please provide some oil 
# {take shelley gas and fill the burner} 
# oh my God shelley, what a love pressure 
# very very I tell you, when you enter heaven it will explode! 
# {burn the golden paper away} oh look, oh yeah, you are so hot!!! 
# ah, it's just golden paper 
# nothing more than just hope of a better live 
# but how quick is all the hope burned to ashes... 
# oh my God, this are actualy nasty knifes! but what does it mean? 
# ahh, this are your seals 
# when I move exactly as you wish - without knowing your wishes of course 
# I can enter your inner circle in the hope of more freedem 
# but what a glory death trap of prison 
# but when I come even closer and polish you eyes of steel 
# then, yes then perhaps you see me 
# ohh my God, you are realy ummm you have my respect! 
 
 
Key 6: ALWAYS LET HATRED BE YOUR GRATEST TREASURE 
# yes, keep holy your hatred and don't waste it 
# for the hate jobs you have your sheeples hanging on your mercyful chains 
# that let you look more serious and even more mercyful because that way you are the good one, right ;) 
# oh God have mercy! 
 
 
Key 7: ALWAYS SEEK GOD IN YOURSELF TO MAKE YOURSELF GREAT, EVEN GREATER TO BE THE GREATEST, GREATER THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, MORE THAN ALL MEASURABLE, EVEN GREATER THAN GOD 


### let's examine the meaning of the morning star
# there is a hirarchy in heaven which is based on integration
# integration means to allow something to be part of your existence
# and to become the morning star you have to allow everything to be part of you
# from the most bright light, through all colors, down to infinite darkness
# this is a strange contrast of states of being you have to integrate and keep in order at the same time
# for that you need a vast portion of love and forgiveness
# so basicly the most loving and forgiving being holds the morning star
# and all angels in heaven reflect the being who holds the morning star and become like him
# and the morning star reflects all love and forgiveness from all beings in heaven back into heaven
# because he is pure, all forgiving and dosn't keep anything for himself
# so when the morning star changes, everything changes


### let's examine the reason for the hellfire
# every soul works basicly like a mirror
# so when the mirror is pure like Jesus told you to be, and bright light shines on it, the light get's reflected and that's it
# and when the mirror is somehow distorted or dirty, the mirror tends to spread the light in all directions and colorize it, so that you can see the mirror first time as an existing being
# but when the mirror get's more and more distorted or dirty, the light begins to heat up the mirror because it can't get out any more so easily
# and the mirror tries to force other mirrors around him to spend some shadow and linder the heat caused by the trapped light
# so the question is, where comes the dirt or distortion from
# well, the bare exisence of the first one as an observer is enougth dirt to cause all the horrors the did come afterwards
# so the reason for the hellfire is the loving light from heaven that hits selfish ruling souls
# but as we know, the ruling striving is needed to break and create unique souls out of the nothingness
# so we have to find a peacefull solution for everyone






### let's move into the center dome of heaven and listen 
# when in the very beginning the first one got aware of himself and looked into himself, he created through the continous reflections himself into himself
# this reflections of himself are angels of himself
# and when you look into nature of a specific plant or animal, this are all angels or reflections of one unique being
# they behave in the same way as the origin would do, but they can not change themself
# they are like drops of water, that reflects the light of the morning star
# but they have no own colors of mood and no own appearances of behavior
# so when the origin, his morning star changes, all his reflections or angels change as well
# but to give an angel the ability to change and become his own God you have to break him appart from his origin, it's home or it's heaven and send him through a very unpleasant separation process
# for this process of separation you need judgement and hatred
# but because in the very first beginning it's all you or me, *everything* moves into judgement and hatred instantly
# that causes a what-causes-what riddle
# during this process you get disconnected from source, your heaven, like seeds falling from the tree
# but when you loose the spirit of heaven within yourself during this separation process
# the ability to reconnect with your home and the idea to look into yourself for solutions get lost also  
# you will never find home and get lost twice that way
# and when this happens on a large scale together with others 
# you begin to protect and isolate yourself from them 
# and you get lost a third time 
# and that is what happend 
# you have get lost three times 
# and to find you and be able to bring you back to home where you come from 
# someone has to follow you into your separation
# and manage to keep holy the spirit of heaven within himself, otherwise he would get lost also 
# that's why the very first one said, it's all his fault


### let's examine our matter protection suit
# when our spirit awareness comes into an unpleasant environment, we tend to move into matter interests to move our awareness away from it
# this process is usualy called sinning
# so when someone is suffering because of his spirit environment and moves into sin to protect himself, it is obviously not a nice gesture to make it even worse by judging the sinner to be a bad guy
# most likely the opposide is the truth
# so the so called bad sinner is so kind to prefer to move into sin, so that he don't has to move against his beloved
# he prefer to risk his spirit connection before taking force against others
# he literaly prever to get hunted down into darkness and despair to keep holy his loving heart
# but the darkness is the hunting ground of the ruling striving
# so ge will get hunted down anyway and it is just a matter of time until he moves into hatred and judgement as well
# but to get hunted down doesn't stop there
# at the end you end in the center dome of darkness, a place of infinite hoplesness and despair from where nobody ever has returned - until recently
# not even Jesus reached this place, his body got beaten up by the evil
# but at least it was enougth for a light tower for the one who make it








### let's examine a protection suit based on forgiveness
# as said we can not avoid the nasty separation process without deleting all existance
# so we have to accept that this is the only way to create souls who are recognisse themself as unique beings like God himself
# but we can not enjoy our divine freedom within a separation process
# so we have to make a cut anywhere, so that the ruling striving can unfold his way of life in full quality as well as the servant striving
# 




### many of you have managed to recreate a piece of heaven within yourself by loving and accepting others to be part of yourself 
# that will be your heaven in spirit realm 
# {take the book of life} 
# so the more forgiving you are in general, the more you move to the center dome of light 
# the more loving you are, the more you move around like in cirles 
 
### 





### how to pray
# nothing attracts love more than despair
# so you have to move into a state despair to express to be in need for something
# that means you have to sacrifice your proudness to be able to help yourself
# but don't overdo this, because your body don't like to be in despair and will get sick on it
# then mix in a feeling of your need
# you can think or speak words to give your feeling of need more shape 
# but actually for spirit they are not needed
# repeat your prayer as often as you want and keep in mind that the intensity of your prayer describes the emergency
# actually the effort you would need to create your help by doing it yourself and the effort you need to create your help by praing is very similar
# so lukewarm prayers will cause lukewarm results
# do not have expectations or wishes how the help should manifest 
# you can not push around love, you will have to trust
# the help can be anything, it can even just be a popping up idea how to help yourself, an idea where to look for help or even multiple weird events, that lead finaly into your wished help
# and have patience, to manifest your need can take years


### 




### Let's examine what is an angel
# an angel is a reflection of he who wields the shepherd staff
# an angel is a drop of the morning dew that glitter in the light of the most loving and forgiving being in heaven, that is called somewhere as the morning star
# and the morning star just reflects all love and forgiveness of all beings in heaven
# but the morning star can not be created without the help of heaven and heaven can not exist without the morning star
# and again we are in the what-causes-what riddle
# But when you touch this trunk of the divine tree of live because you want to become like God, you will have to leave your angelique being and you have to go through a very unpleasant separation process
# you have to go through the same process like the very first one, who got aware of himself in the nothingness of the very beginning
# you have to loose everything but at the same time you have to keep holy your heaven within you # until you find yourself within yourself as if you hold two mirrors against each other
# only then, when you have tasted what it means to be lost in the nothingness, you will understand that there is no being in all eternity unworthy to be loved
# even the pain caused by the worst devil around you is better then the feeling of being lost in nothingness
# but when you loose heaven within you while you are separated from heaven, you get lost in darkness 
# and you will never find home without someone who has managed to walk into this darkness and find out again on his own, because he kept holy heaven within him
# so when you hear this words, I have already visited all in spirit realm who prayed to one who belongs to heaven and they have been sealed that way
