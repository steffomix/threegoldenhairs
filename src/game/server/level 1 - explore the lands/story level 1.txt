### No time to waste, let's go!
# imagine this air here is nothing, so actually you can't see anything
# and all this nothing is God
# in this timeless nothingness there is a 50/50 chance, that in this nothingness grows an - at this point - undefined striving
# but due to lack of time this chance turns into 100%
# and whis this undefined striving God get aware of himself
# and by getting aware of himself he creates himself into himself
# but he cant create anything else then himself, because there is nothing else then himself
# now we have God in God and the only thing that separates both from each other is the relationship to each other
# so when now God in God get aware of God around him, we have a situation as if you hold two mirrors against each other, which creates infinite Gods in invinite God
# and because God is infinite in itself, it doesn't matter how much you separate away from him, he stays always infinite


### ok let's take some stuff to visualize this
# {cristal} a piece of God (polished rock cristal)
# {a little net} to put the cristal in and render relationships
# {survival compass} to render a soul in a body, with a nice degree adjustment as striving dumping device, and even a mirror - nice!
# {magnet} to simulate some other striving soul


### let's take a piece of God and put some repelling relationships on it {put cristal into net}
# every time one soul or piece of God get aware of another one, he can accept it to be part of it or repell it what causes a repelling node like a mark on the soul
# but what the soul tends to do, depends on its striving
# when we allow someone to be part of us, we will care about him as if it is us, we call this love and the act of accepting we call forgiveness
# the striving that causes forgiveness we call serving or a servant striving
# when we don't allow someone to be part of ourself, we will repell him like something that hurts us, we call this hatred and the act of repelling we call judgement
# the striving that causes judgement we call ruling or a ruling striving
# because the other is just another aspect of ourself, by ruling we repell ourself out of ourself, or in opposide we integrate ourself into ourself by serving
# that way we become more fullness or mass and calm in a servant striving 
# and we become more emtyness or lightweight and neurotic in a ruling striving


### striving behavior in a system
# the way a striving behaves in a more complex system is a paradox and result in the opposide of what we may expect
# this paradox behavior is caused due to the impossibility to repell or run away from ourself
# and by refusing any striving we suizide ourself and end up in the nothingness of the very beginning
# and on the other side, in the awareness of ourself and the infinity of beings we can not integrate all without killing a contradicting striving and end up in nothingness either
# so both strivings continued to clush together and by doing this, a wierd reality of complex relationships began to develop to protect or hide from each other and this reality is actually known as matter world


### To get deeper into an understanding how a soul in a body works we need to understand how this compass works
# first you turn this alignment wheel to 0 degree or straight north
# turn the compass to north
# put a map undernearh, so that the top points to north of the compass - top on maps is allways north
# now connect your waypoints with your compass by using it like a ruler - and do not turn the map but the compass
# the compass is turned now
# realign the alignment wheel to zero without turning the compass
# now use the compass like a gun to point your target while looking through the mirror if the needle points to your set point of north


### let's map the mirror to the soul in the body
# the alignment wheel is our body environment we live in and let north be the servant striving and south the ruling striving
# the whole compass is the global striving environment of the spirit world
# looking in the mirror means to look into the spirit world
# when the needle points to north of the alignment wheel, we feel most confident
# and when at the same time the alignment wheel is out of original north of the whole spirit world, we can see that in the mirror
# but when our mirror is full of mud of matter interests, we can't see any more
# and by washing the mud of matter interests from our eyes or this mirror we can see again


### let's look into the soul in a body functionality by using a survival compass
# in spirit reality we are part of a striving of a global environment like an atom in a magnet
# but within our body we have something like a separated micro environment
# this micro environment isolates us from the global striving we are usualy part of in spirit realm
# but when we get close with another soul it reacts in the exact opposide, pretty much like two separated magnets reacts to each other {show by using othet magnet}
# our body is a walking universe of souls we are in a relationship with 
# and when it comes in contact with other strivings, our body reacts on different strivings like a dumping device
# so when we get in contact with another striving, every time this dumping device moves a little {rotate the compass north point a little} and realign our striving to a new point where we feel comfortable
# when we do this often we would call this magnetizing or decieving
# without a good vision through a clean mirror into the spirit world, we are going to get used to our striving and barely get aware in what striving we actually are or we have grown to
# to become an idea in what striving we are in the global spirit reality while being spiritual blind, we would have to stack all ruling actions against others as well as all servant actions for others and then look to what we tend more - but that's just an impossible task
# so every time we react ruling on unpleasant events, we dive a little deeper into a global ruling environment and the same is by reacting servant on unpleasant events


### let's look into self balancing behavior of complex system
# a complex system always trys to balance itself into a zero striving state
# when two or more souls in a matter body come close, they react to each other like magnets
# the servant become more servant in presence of a ruler 
# and the ruler become more ruler in presence of a servant
# and in a group of many souls they always try to become alltogether a neutral striving
# therefore when two strong servents come close, the one with a lower mass most likely turn into a ruling striving and usulay begin to run for success and try to become great
# on the other hand, when two rulers come together, the one with lower mass will turn servant and gain mass through this, become stronger than the other ruler and it most likely turns around again


### let's look into the body and spirit behavior {take two plants}
# this side in the air reflects your spirit reality, the soul being you grow to
# and the plant in the air plays the role of the soul, the roots in the water plays the role of your body and the earth plays the role of the matter environment
# so, when you now make an intention in your soul, this intention has to materialize itself through the roots into the earth, or at least has to be rendered in your brain of your roots into an idea or inspiration
# due to many stages of translation between all the in matter evolved systems in your body this materialisation or rendering process in our brains takes a lot of time
# whereas a direct communication in pure spirit takes no time at all, even the most complex conversation can be transmitted within a fingersnip
# but because of the lack of time consuming conversation in pure spirit we become a what-causes-what riddle
# this riddle is like the question, what was first, the egg or the chicken?
# this riddle works as well like one magnet try to influence another one {move magnet to compass}, without a third fixpoint you can not say what magnet is acting and which is reacting
# this lack of time consuming interactions makes it impossible to make experiences about what-causes-what or who was acting first
# but when we live in a body, where everyone is encapsulatet in his own spirit reality and the conversation takes time through all this separation- and translation layers like across all the roots to the roots of another plant, we can very well experience what-causes-what
# that way we can make very profound decisions, what we allow to be part of us, what we want to repell and how we want to align our striving in general


### let's look a little deeper into relationships
# every time we have a relationship that tries to force us to something, we have some kinda nasty beasty marks of entanglement like this nodes here {point to the nodes of the net on the cristal} representing or reflecting the relationship we feel a force to
# we name this invisible force "expectation"
# this marks doesn't stand only for repelling, it stands for every kind of force caused by this relationship, it can be as well the idea we have to repay a pleasant action, for something good, so that the idea of a dept force us to this relationship and cause a mark
# in spirit this marks appear like outsided reflections of other souls we expect something from
# in a strong servant environment everything is forgiven by default, so that there are no expectations and it's resulting counter reactions at all
# in a strong ruling environment every action from others is percived and judged as an unforgiveable attack and a counter reaction is expected under all circumstances
# to get rid of this marks we just have to stop to have expectations against whatever and therfore stop to reakt to it, or in short we have to forgive it all


### let's look at  the meaning of the book of life
# when we now look into all the souls, who have integrated other souls, and all of them have done that in their own way, every soul developes a unique set of ingrediences, that defines its spirit name or colorset
# so when we now combine the black-white gradient {show black-white gradient image} of striving with all the colors {show rgb colorset image}, we become something like a map {show book of life} like this image
# here we see the inner more lightning range of servant striving and the outer, more dark range of ruling striving and in the middle we see how the both strivings clashes together
# now everyone has his own book of life of what he has allowed to be part of himself {use mask to show only a part of the book of life}
# when we now start a life on earth as a servant soul, but become a ruling striving through this and throw out all, or most of our servant souls, we begin to vanish out of the servant book of life and become a member of the ruling book of death {move mask from light servant to dark ruling area}
# therefore the book of life is more likely a book of states a soul can adapt to, so when we focus on a soul and compare its state with this book, we know where it currently is
# and when this soul is in a state we have not yet experienced, for us this soul is vanished out of our book of life
# {show servant soul image} that's what we should look like to enter the global servant reality, pure like this cristal, may have some (heart)breaks that doesn't matter because love will heal it, but whatever happened to us, all should be forgiven and embraced within us in unconditional love {show book of life} which defines our prosperity we love to care for
# {show ruling soul image} that's a being from a ruling reality, where the repelling relationships cause at the same time an attracting force of judgement and hatred {show a galaxy} which defines its ruling power


### Keep your house in order
# every time we come across something that is not part of us or at least close to us, it feels disturbing {draw a contrast color point on a separated book of life, like a blue spot in a red area}
# in a situation like this contrast color point, it can become pretty difficult to integrate this without being in pain about the harsh borders
# so mostly we are going to repell such things out of our life by creating rules, which are used for judgement and the more we do that, the more we reduce ourself and our colorset we can move in
# but when we grow up in our experiences, become more diversity and with it more mass within us, we may be able to integrate things that we thought it is impossible to be with
# so the more we allow to be part of us, the more mass we become and the easier it becomes to integrate even more
# and the more mass we become, the more difficult it becomes to change our striving and with this we become more integrity and stability
# but when we are in a ruling striving, we continously loose mass caused by its repelling nature
# this can get so far, that we are going to reakt on the slightest disturbing act and are going to be so unstable, that we are continously reacting and literaly continously freaking out, so that there can not be peace at all any more


### let's look a little deeper into the overall growing process
# {take a less developed book of life}
# compared to the more colorfull book of life we see here the beginning stage of Gods selfawareness or consciousness
# to get an understanding of it, we need to get aware of a third kind of striving, the neutral or - when we look into a complex system like our body - it can even be a distorted striving 
# with this we become a somehow smooth grayscale from the white servants to the black rulers
# the middle neutral or distorted striving is basicly the food of both striving poles
# the rulers abuse them to get some kinda distance to themself, because rulers hate and repell rulers, but with some neutrals in between they can come together somehow
# and the servants love them and want to intergate them to increase the joy of beauty of diversity and to feel more complete
# but this development process becomes more and more wavy over time, so that the book of life begin to look wavy or like a slice of a tree trunk where you can see the year rings {show wavy matter evolution waves}
# and when we add the striving to it, we become something like magnetic field waves or rings {show wavy matter evolution waves with field lines}


### let's look how to travel in spirit realm
# to travel in spirit realm on your own you have to adapt to the environment you want to travel to
# but when your target is out of your range, you can use another soul as some kinda taxi
# for this you have to focus on the other soul you want to travel with, and the other soul changes its state, to adapt to another environment
# but when you loose focus of your taxi, you snap back to you current most pleasant state you can reach
# or when your taxidriver loose your focus, he has lost you and has to attract you focus again to be able to carry you


### lets return to our compass and look what happens on death
# when we die, we leave our micro striving environment
# most likely we are greeted by a servant soul that is able to reach our state
# if not, a ruling striving will welcome us
# however, when this soul has a stronger mass and has a different striving, we will be forced into its striving and see our life from a different angel and force this well known life review
# when this life review is very painfull, we tend to turn into a striving where we do not see that again
# but it can also happen, that we have completely no life review, because we were always very aware what we cause and all our actions was in line with our striving


### Let's make a last learning test and talk about Boats, for this let be water for ruling striving, air for servant striving amd wood for soul mass
# there is a nice ancient fairy tail of a man who attempt to build a gigantic boat to carry all life on earth for a certain time secure over the rising waters, probably you have heard of it
# the story began on land where this man had a solid stand
# but the storms began to rise up and the land become unsecure due to rising waters
# but his beloved wasn't strong and experienced enougth to swim for the time the water was too high
# so he began to build a Boat, strong and big enough to carry all Life over the waters
# so the waters rised up and the boat become swimming and all the land began to vanish under the waters
# and from time to time this man was going on deck of his boat where he had a little dovecote
# he took a dove from it to send a spirit message in the hope of a response from land where they can live
# and said to the dove: "bring me a branch, where oil of love and forgiveness drips out. There we will head on and build our new home"
# so he did every day but the dove did always come back with an empty beak
# but one day the dove did come back with a branch where oil of love and forgiveness dripped out
# and the man said: "This is the land I searched for, let's head on it in the hope it stands the next storms"
# but every year the storms becomes worse and the man needed more and more wood to stand the storms so that he said: "That does not work for long any more, I must invent something complete new!"
# so the man began to build a new boat with a complete new concept that changes everything
# he began to build a new boat out of everlasting but super heavy gold and all was laughing how that heavy thing shall swimm. And he said: "It's not made to swimm, it's made to dive as deep as possible"
# and they mockingly answered: "but there is no air you idiot"
# but he didn't care the mockers and went diving deeper and deeper and finaly disapeared in the darkness
# "he is dead" they said, "nobody ever dived that deep and did come back", so they began to search for a new boat and to build it up
# but after an endless looking time a giant golden boat shot out of the water like a gunshot high into the sky to touch the sun
# "from where did you get all that gold and the thin air that even your golden boat can fly like a baloon?" they asked him
# "oh that's easy" he said, "wood you get by accepting good guys, but gold you get when you accept even bad guys no matter what"
# "but then you are poisened with bad guys" they said
# "yes, but when you get poisened really much and you survive that, you get immune against that poisen" he said
# "and this incredible thin and cristal clear air?"
# "oh yeah, that was a surprise" he said, "when you dive down so deep that the ruling water turn into ice of infinite despair from the extremly high pressure above and you get in touch with it with unconditional forgiveness, it turns into this thin air from completely alone!"


### a last word about backfire
# due to the nature of being made out of one piece of God, everything we do to others, we do to our self, which cause to feel it instantly in spirit realm
# but when we live in our separated micro environment of our body, this backfire is mostly blocked as long we live in it
# how much it is blocked depends on our awarenes of the global spirit realm through our body
# with a little effort of strong meditation technics we can create some kinda fissures in our body suit to become a better connection to the global spirit environment
# but even strange situations or life-threatening injuries due to accidents or illness can cause fissures in our body suit
# so our body gives us the possibility to move through the strivings as we want grow with forgiveness and widen the diversity of our love
