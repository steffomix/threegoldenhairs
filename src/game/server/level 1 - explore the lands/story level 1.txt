### No time to waste, let's go!
# imagine this air here is nothing, so actually you can't see anything
# and all this nothingness is God
# in this timeless nothingness there is a 50/50 chance, that in this nothingness grows an - at this point - undefined striving
# but due to lack of time this chance turns into 100%
# and with this undefined striving God get aware of himself
# and by getting aware of himself he creates himself into himself
# but he can't create anything else then himself, because there is nothing else then himself
# now we have God in God and the only thing that separates both from each other is the relationship to each other
# {use big mirror} so when now God in God get aware of God around him or in him, we have a situation as if you hold two mirrors against each other, which creates infinite Gods in infinite God
# and because God is infinite in himself, the amount of reflections is limitless
# but there was an impurity since the very beginning of the awakening of God that caused all the mess we have today
# and we are going now to figure out what it is and how it all works
# but that's a long story, so let's go


### ok let's take some stuff to visualize this
# {cristal} a piece of God (polished rock cristal)
# {a little net} to put the cristal in and render relationships
# {survival compass} to render a soul in a body, with a nice degree adjustment as striving dumping device, and even a mirror - nice!
# {magnet} to simulate some other striving soul


### let's take a piece of God and put some repelling relationships on it {put cristal into net}
# every time one soul or piece of God get aware of another one, he can accept it to be part of it or repel it
# but what the soul tends to do, depends on its striving
# when we allow something to be part of us, it is within us and we will care about it as if is is ourselves
# we call this caring love
# and the act of accepting or letting in we call forgiveness
# the striving that causes forgiveness we call serving or a servant striving
# but when we don't allow something or someone to be part of ourselves, we will repel him like something that hurts us
# and the act of repelling or throwing out we call judgement
# the striving that causes judgement we call ruling or a ruling striving
# but because the other is just another aspect of ourselves, by ruling we repel ourselves out of ourselves, or in opposite by serving we integrate ourselves into ourselves
# so that way we become more fullness or mass and become calm in a servant striving
# and we become more emptiness or lightweight and panicking in a ruling striving


### let's look at the striving behavior in a system
# the way a striving behaves in a more complex system is a paradox and result in the opposite of what we may expect
# this paradox behavior is caused due to the impossibility to repel or run away from ourselves
# and by refusing any striving we suicide our meaning of life and end up in the nothingness of the very beginning
# and on the other side, to just integrate everything would make ourselves complete meaningless
# so both strivings continued to clash together and by doing this, a weird reality of complex relationships began to develop
# literally everything and everyone tried to protect or hide from each other
# and the actually the deepest and darkest point of isolation is the matter world


### let's go deeper into an understanding how a soul in a body works
# for that we need to understand how this survival compass works
# first you need to find a place with very low magnetic influence like outside in the wilds
# now turn this alignment wheel to 0 degree or straight north
# {turn the compass to north}
# put a map underneath, so that the top points to north of the compass
# the top on maps is always north
# now make two endpoints for the path we want to walk
# now connect your waypoints with your compass by using it like a ruler
# make sure you don't turn the underlying map in any way
# {turn the compass} so, the compass is turned now
# now turn zero-point of the alignment wheel to the north of the compass needle
# on the origin top you can read the degree or the direction now, you have to walk
# you should write it down and put it on a very save place, just for the case you run in trouble
# now use the compass like a gun to point your target while looking through the mirror if the needle points to your custom set point of north


### let's translate the meaning of the compass to the soul in the body
# the alignment wheel represents the striving of our body environment we live in
# and let north we let be the servant striving and south the ruling striving
# the magnetic field of earth represents the global striving environment of the spirit world
# looking in the mirror means to look into the spirit world
# when the needle points to north of the alignment wheel, we feel most confident in our body
# and when at the same time the alignment wheel is out of original north of the whole spirit world, we can see that in the mirror
# so we always know the true direction to where we are walking
# but when our mirror is full of mud of matter interests, we can't see any more in what direction we are truly walking
# and by washing the mud of matter interests from our eyes or this mirror we can see again
# and when we have been walking blind for a long time and become true vision again or leave our body due to death for example, we may be very surprised where we have end up
# so the upside of our body armor suit is the isolation from spirit influence
# but when the isolation becomes too dense or cause too much distortions, we wlak blind and loose track of orientation


### let's look into the soul in a body functionality by using a survival compass
# in spirit reality, without a body we are part of a striving of it's global environment like an atom in a magnet or a drop of water in an ocean
# so, once dead and without a body, we can't change our striving any more
# but within our body we have something like a separated micro environment
# this micro environment isolates us from the global striving of the in spirit realm
# but when we get close with another soul in another body suit, the strivings are reacting pretty much like two separated magnets reacts to each other
# {show by using other magnet} they react contradicting to each other, so that servants attract rulers and rulers attract servants
# as well as servants repel servants or turn into rulers
# or rulers repel rulers or turn into servants
# so that in summary a complex system always tries to find a balanced or striving


### let's look at the soul mass
# the more you allow to be part of you, the bigger is your soul mass
# the stronger is your magnetizing influence
# and the more difficult it is to change your striving
# so a soul that has gone through many things in a servant way becomes a strong magnetizing appearance due to its heavy mass
# whereas someone with a low mass has to establish his magnetizing effect through souls who are willing to serve him
# so that souls in a ruling striving always try to find other souls or a group of souls to participate from it's mass, always try to bind them and move into the most ruling position
# whereas souls with a serving striving always try to go alone and serve everyone moves along without establishing a binding relationship


### let's look at the body functionality as a dumping device
# even an atom, nearly the smallest building block of matter is already a collection of many souls or shards of God
# therefore our body is a walking universe of souls we are in a relationship with and creates it's spirit micro environment
# and when it comes in contact with other strivings, our body reacts on different strivings like a dumping device due to its vast complexity
# so when we get in contact with another striving, every time this dumping device moves a little {rotate the compass north point a little} and realign our striving to a new point where we feel comfortable
# when we do this often we would call this type of influence magnetizing or deceiving
# and due to the dumping effect of our body environment, we easily get used to a different striving
# and to make it worse, without a good vision through a clean mirror into the spirit world, we barely get aware in what striving we actually are or we have turned to
# so every time we react ruling on whatever events, we dive a little deeper into ruling striving
# and the same is by reacting servant on whatever events
# so in theory we can remember our behavior an recalculate a guess to what direction we actually strive to


### let's look into the body and spirit behavior of time {take two plants}
# this side in the air reflects your spirit reality, the soul being you grow to
# and the plant in the air plays the role of the soul in the global spirit environment
# and the roots in the earth plays the role of the matter environment
# so, when you now make an intention in your soul, this intention has to materialize itself through the roots into the earth, or at least has to be rendered in your brain part of your roots into an idea or inspiration
# due to so many stages of translation between all the roots in matter this materialisation or rendering process takes a lot of time
# whereas a direct communication in pure spirit takes no time at all, even the most complex conversation can be transmitted within a fingersnip {make a fingersnip}
# but because of the lack of time consuming conversation in pure spirit we become a what-causes-what riddle
# pretty much like the instant reaction of magnets to each other, where you can not say, what magnet influences what
# this riddle is like the question, what was first, the egg or the chicken?
# this lack of time consuming interactions makes it impossible to make experiences about what-causes-what or who was acting first
# but when we live in a body, where everyone is encapsulated in his own spirit reality and the conversation takes time through all this separation- and translation layers like across all the roots to the roots of another plant, we can very well experience what-causes-what
# that way we can make very profound decisions, what we allow to be part of us, what we want to repel and how we want to align our striving in general


### let's look a little deeper into binding relationships marks
# every time we have a relationship that tries to force us to something, we have some kinda nasty beasty marks of entanglement on our soul like this nodes here {point to the nodes of the net on the cristal} representing or reflecting the relationship we feel a force to
# this nodes work like chains that binds souls together
# we usually name this invisible forces "expectation", "debt" or "responsibility" to or from others
# this marks doesn't stand only for repelling, it stands for every kind of force caused by this relationship, it can be as well the idea we have to repay a pleasant action, for something good, so that the idea of a dept force us to this relationship and cause a mark
# so basically we can't even buy or sell anything without causing such binding marks on our soul
# in spirit this marks appear like outside reflections of other souls we expect something from
# in a strong servant environment there is no binding at all, not even rules, so that there are no expectations, debts or responsibilities and it's resulting counter reactions at all
# in a strong ruling environment every action has to be answered with an expected reaction along the current rules


### let's look at states or moods a soul can move into
# for this we use this mood map, usually called book of life
# when we now look into all the souls, who have integrated other souls, and all of them have done that in their own way, every soul develops a unique set of ingredients, that defines its spirit name or color set
# so when we now combine the black-white gradient {show black-white gradient image} of striving with all the colors {show rgb color set image}, we become something like a map {show book of life} like this image
# here we see the inner more lightning range of servant striving and the outer, more dark range of ruling striving and in the middle we see how the both strivings clashes together
# now everyone has his own book of life of what he has allowed to be part of himself {use mask on book of life}
# and in the center of it the soul feels most confident and it's the souls home then
# when we now start a life on earth as a servant soul, but become a ruling striving through this and throw out all, or most of our servant souls, we begin to vanish out of the servant book of life and light and become a member of the ruling book of death and darkness {move mask from light servant to dark ruling area}
# so when we repel pretty much everything, we have nothing to look at any more and it becomes pretty dark then
# therefore the book of life is more likely a book of states a soul can adapt or move to, so when we focus on a soul and compare its state with this book, we know where it currently is
# and when this soul is in a state we have not yet experienced, for us this soul is vanished out of our book of life


### let's look how to expand our book of life
# every time you move into a different state or mood of being or even change your striving, everything you have ever experienced looks different
# because you see everything from a different perspective of being
# even the state where you come from looks different
# so when you move out of your well known states of being, it can become pretty difficult to move back into your known states when you don't know how they look from there
# so you can really get lost in unknown states of being
# and it becomes absolute impossible, when you have bind yourself into ruling relationships, who always try to keep you on place for whatever reason
# that's why this binding ruling relationship marks are called marks of the beast
# so to really truly expand your book of life, you have to move into unknown states or moods and move back home on your very own
# only then you have mastered the unknown and have become the ability to move freely within then further on


### let's look how to travel in spirit realm
# to travel in spirit realm on your own you have to adapt to the environment you want to travel to
# but when your target is out of your range, you can use another soul as a taxi ot train
# for that the other soul or taxi has to move into your state of being and try to get your awareness first
# then your taxi or train has to get your trust
# because in spirit realm it is impossible to get a preview of your target without instantly moving to it
# so in spirit realm we can move only by trust and not by sight as we do in matter realm
# as soon as your taxi begins to move, you have to release your focus on where you currently are
# otherwise you would always snap back to your old state you come from
# and it becomes absolute impossible to move with your taxi, when you have bind yourself into ruling relationships, who always try to keep you on place for whatever reason
# that's why this binding ruling relationship marks are called marks of the beast
# once you moved into a very unknown state of being and feel confident there, you will snap into it
# and you will not be able to find the state of being where you did come from
# so once you really moved into a completely new state of being, the old one begins to vanish and becomes unreachable
# you would need a taxi again or a gate, that shows your old state of being from the perspective of your new state of being
# but you should know, that gates are always one-way gates
# once you moved through them, you have to find a return gate or a taxi of your trust to move you back
# for a bidirectional connection you have to create a tunnel, that works like an additional third state of being to connect two states of being who are impossible to bridge for you
# one of the most well known tunnels has been created by Yeshua or Jesus
# to enter his tunnel, you have to find him spiritually, his very true spirit being
# his matter name or body alone, however you call him or you think he looked like is completely useless
# but because the state of being has become so bad on a large scale, that even the tunnel of Yeshua has become unreachable for many, an even deeper tunnel has been created recently
# and in this revelation I show you how to find the entry point of Yeshuas tunnel, that is basically unconditional love, forgiveness and having no marks
# and for the case this seems to be unreachable for you, I show you as well how to find the entry point of the new tunnel created by me, that is basically infinite desperation and hopelessness and having no expectations any more, or just be spiritual dead
# so spirit realm can be very confusing, far more confusing than walking first time through a big forest or a city


### Keep your house in order
# every time we come across something that is not part of us or at least close to us, it feels disturbing {draw a contrast color point on a separated book of life, like a blue spot in a red area}
# in a situation like this contrast color point, it can become pretty difficult to integrate this without being in pain about the harsh borders
# in spirit realm we would connect this areas with gates or tunnels, but they are always a nasty and painful thing, disturbing the spirit harmony
# so mostly we try to repel such things out of our spirit reality completely
# but when we grow up in our experiences, become more diversity and with it more mass within us, we may be able to integrate things that we thought it is impossible to be with
# so the more we allow to be part of us, the more mass we become and the easier it becomes to integrate even more and the separated spots grow together
# but the more mass we become, the more difficult it becomes to change our striving
# because our ruling or serving striving is the most primitive state of being at all
# all meanings of our life, our lifestyle, all dreams we have for our life are based on them
# so once a striving has been chosen, we have to literally die for ourselves to change it


### let's look a little deeper into the overall growing process
# {take a less developed book of life}
# compared to the more colorfull book of life we see here the beginning stage of Gods selfawareness or consciousness
# to get an understanding of it, we need to get aware of a third kind of striving, the neutral or - when we look into a complex system like our body - it can even be a distorted striving 
# with this we become a somehow smooth grayscale from the white servants to the black rulers
# the middle neutral or distorted striving is basicly the food of both striving poles
# the rulers abuse them to get some kinda distance to themself, because rulers hate and repell rulers, but with some neutrals in between they can come together somehow
# and the servants love them and want to intergate them to increase the joy of beauty of diversity and to feel more complete
# but this development process becomes more and more wavy over time, so that the book of life begin to look wavy or like a slice of a tree trunk where you can see the year rings {show wavy matter evolution waves}
# and when we add the striving to it, we become something like magnetic field waves or rings {show wavy matter evolution waves with field lines}



### lets return to our compass and look what happens on death
# when we die, we leave our micro striving environment
# most likely we are greeted by a servant soul that is able to reach our state
# if not, a ruling striving will welcome us
# however, when this soul has a stronger mass and has a different striving, we will be forced into its striving and see our life from a different angel and force this well known life review
# when this life review is very painfull, we tend to turn into a striving where we do not see that again
# but it can also happen, that we have completely no life review, because we were always very aware what we cause and all our actions was in line with our striving


### Let's make a last learning test and talk about Boats, for this let be water for ruling striving, air for servant striving amd wood for soul mass
# there is a nice ancient fairy tail of a man who attempt to build a gigantic boat to carry all life on earth for a certain time secure over the rising waters, probably you have heard of it
# the story began on land where this man had a solid stand
# but the storms began to rise up and the land become unsecure due to rising waters
# but his beloved wasn't strong and experienced enougth to swim for the time the water was too high
# so he began to build a Boat, strong and big enough to carry all Life over the waters
# so the waters rised up and the boat become swimming and all the land began to vanish under the waters
# and from time to time this man was going on deck of his boat where he had a little dovecote
# he took a dove from it to send a spirit message in the hope of a response from land where they can live
# and said to the dove: "bring me a branch, where oil of love and forgiveness drips out. There we will head on and build our new home"
# so he did every day but the dove did always come back with an empty beak
# but one day the dove did come back with a branch where oil of love and forgiveness dripped out
# and the man said: "This is the land I searched for, let's head on it in the hope it stands the next storms"
# but every year the storms becomes worse and the man needed more and more wood to stand the storms so that he said: "That does not work for long any more, I must invent something complete new!"
# so the man began to build a new boat with a complete new concept that changes everything
# he began to build a new boat out of everlasting but super heavy gold and all was laughing how that heavy thing shall swimm. And he said: "It's not made to swimm, it's made to dive as deep as possible"
# and they mockingly answered: "but there is no air you idiot"
# but he didn't care the mockers and went diving deeper and deeper and finaly disapeared in the darkness
# "he is dead" they said, "nobody ever dived that deep and did come back", so they began to search for a new boat and to build it up
# but after an endless looking time a giant golden boat shot out of the water like a gunshot high into the sky to touch the sun
# "from where did you get all that gold and the thin air that even your golden boat can fly like a baloon?" they asked him
# "oh that's easy" he said, "wood you get by accepting good guys, but gold you get when you accept even bad guys no matter what"
# "but then you are poisened with bad guys" they said
# "yes, but when you get poisened really much and you survive that, you get immune against that poisen" he said
# "and this incredible thin and cristal clear air?"
# "oh yeah, that was a surprise" he said, "when you dive down so deep that the ruling water turn into ice of infinite despair from the extremly high pressure above and you get in touch with it with unconditional forgiveness, it turns into this thin air from completely alone!"


### a last word about backfire
# due to the nature of being made out of one piece of God, everything we do to others, we do to our self, which cause to feel it instantly in spirit realm
# but when we live in our separated micro environment of our body, this backfire is mostly blocked as long we live in it
# how much it is blocked depends on our awarenes of the global spirit realm through our body
# with a little effort of strong meditation technics we can create some kinda fissures in our body suit to become a better connection to the global spirit environment
# but even strange situations or life-threatening injuries due to accidents or illness can cause fissures in our body suit
# so our body gives us the possibility to move through the strivings as we want grow with forgiveness and widen the diversity of our love
