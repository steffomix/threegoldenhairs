### No time to waste, let's go!
# imagine this air here is nothing, so actually you can't see anything
# and all this nothingness is God
# in this timeless nothingness there is a 50/50 chance, that in this nothingness grows an - at this point - undefined striving
# but due to lack of time this chance turns into 100%
# and with this undefined striving God get aware of himself
# and by getting aware of himself he creates himself into himself
# but he can't create anything else then himself, because there is nothing else then himself
# now we have God in God and the only thing that separates both from each other is the relationship to each other
# {use big mirror} so when now God in God get aware of God around him or in him, we have a situation as if you hold two mirrors against each other, which creates infinite Gods in infinite God
# and because God is infinite in himself, the amount of reflections is limitless
# but there was an impurity since the very beginning of the awakening of God that caused all the mess we have today
# and we are going now to figure out what it is and how it all works
# but that's a long story, so let's go


### ok let's take some stuff to visualize this
# {cristal} a piece of God (polished rock cristal)
# {a little net} to put the cristal in and render relationships
# {survival compass} to render a soul in a body, with a nice degree adjustment as striving dumping device, and even a mirror - nice!
# {magnet} to simulate some other striving soul


### let's take a piece of God and put some repelling relationships on it {put cristal into net}
# every time one soul or piece of God get aware of another one, he can accept it to be part of it or repel it
# but what the soul tends to do, depends on its striving
# when we allow something to be part of us, it is within us and we will care about it as if is is ourselves
# we call this caring love
# and the act of accepting or letting in we call forgiveness
# the striving that causes forgiveness we call serving or a servant striving
# but when we don't allow something or someone to be part of ourselves, we will repel him like something that hurts us
# and the act of repelling or throwing out we call judgement
# the striving that causes judgement we call ruling or a ruling striving
# but because the other is just another aspect of ourselves, by ruling we repel ourselves out of ourselves, or in opposite by serving we integrate ourselves into ourselves
# so that way we become more fullness or mass and become calm in a servant striving
# and we become more emptiness or lightweight and panicking in a ruling striving


### let's look at the striving behavior in a system
# the way a striving behaves in a more complex system is a paradox and result in the opposite of what we may expect
# this paradox behavior is caused due to the impossibility to repel or run away from ourselves
# and by refusing any striving we suicide our meaning of life and end up in the nothingness of the very beginning
# and on the other side, to just integrate everything would make ourselves complete meaningless
# so both strivings continued to clash together and by doing this, a weird reality of complex relationships began to develop
# literally everything and everyone tried to protect or hide from each other
# and the actually the deepest and darkest point of isolation is the matter world


### let's go deeper into an understanding how a soul in a body works
# for that we need to understand how this survival compass works
# first you need to find a place with very low magnetic influence like outside in the wilds
# now turn this alignment wheel to 0 degree or straight north
# {turn the compass to north}
# put a map underneath, so that the top points to north of the compass
# the top on maps is always north
# now make two endpoints for the path we want to walk
# now connect your waypoints with your compass by using it like a ruler
# make sure you don't turn the underlying map in any way
# {turn the compass} so, the compass is turned now
# now turn zero-point of the alignment wheel to the north of the compass needle
# on the origin top you can read the degree or the direction now, you have to walk
# you should write it down and put it on a very save place, just for the case you run in trouble
# now use the compass like a gun to point your target while looking through the mirror if the needle points to your custom set point of north


### let's translate the meaning of the compass to the soul in the body
# the alignment wheel represents the striving of our body environment we live in
# and let north we let be the servant striving and south the ruling striving
# the magnetic field of earth represents the global striving environment of the spirit world
# looking in the mirror means to look into the spirit world
# when the needle points to north of the alignment wheel, we feel most confident in our body
# and when at the same time the alignment wheel is out of original north of the whole spirit world, we can see that in the mirror
# so we always know the true direction to where we are walking
# but when our mirror is full of mud of matter interests, we can't see any more in what direction we are truly walking
# and by washing the mud of matter interests from our eyes or this mirror we can see again
# and when we have been walking blind for a long time and become true vision again or leave our body due to death for example, we may be very surprised where we have end up
# so the upside of our body armor suit is the isolation from spirit influence
# but when the isolation becomes too dense or cause too much distortions, we wlak blind and loose track of orientation


### let's look into the soul in a body functionality by using a survival compass
# in spirit reality, without a body we are part of a striving of it's global environment like an atom in a magnet or a drop of water in an ocean
# so, once dead and without a body, we can't change our striving any more
# but within our body we have something like a separated micro environment
# this micro environment isolates us from the global striving of the in spirit realm
# but when we get close with another soul in another body suit, the strivings are reacting pretty much like two separated magnets reacts to each other
# {show by using other magnet} they react contradicting to each other, so that servants attract rulers and rulers attract servants
# as well as servants repel servants or turn into rulers
# or rulers repel rulers or turn into servants
# so that in summary a complex system always tries to find a balanced or striving


### let's look at the soul mass
# the more you allow to be part of you, the bigger is your soul mass
# the stronger is your magnetizing influence
# and the more difficult it is to change your striving
# so a soul that has gone through many things in a servant way becomes a strong magnetizing appearance due to its heavy mass
# whereas someone with a low mass has to establish his magnetizing effect through souls who are willing to serve him
# so that souls in a ruling striving always try to find other souls or a group of souls to participate from it's mass, always try to bind them and move into the most ruling position
# whereas souls with a serving striving always try to go alone and serve everyone moves along without establishing a binding relationship


### let's look at the body functionality as a dumping device
# even an atom, nearly the smallest building block of matter is already a collection of many souls or shards of God
# therefore our body is a walking universe of souls we are in a relationship with and creates it's spirit micro environment
# and when it comes in contact with other strivings, our body reacts on different strivings like a dumping device due to its vast complexity
# so when we get in contact with another striving, every time this dumping device moves a little {rotate the compass north point a little} and realign our striving to a new point where we feel comfortable
# when we do this often we would call this type of influence magnetizing or deceiving
# and due to the dumping effect of our body environment, we easily get used to a different striving
# and to make it worse, without a good vision through a clean mirror into the spirit world, we barely get aware in what striving we actually are or we have turned to
# so every time we react ruling on whatever events, we dive a little deeper into ruling striving
# and the same is by reacting servant on whatever events
# so in theory we can remember our behavior an recalculate a guess to what direction we actually strive to


### let's look into the body and spirit behavior of time {take two plants}
# this side in the air reflects your spirit reality, the soul being you grow to
# and the plant in the air plays the role of the soul in the global spirit environment
# and the roots in the earth plays the role of the matter environment
# so, when you now make an intention in your soul, this intention has to materialize itself through the roots into the earth, or at least has to be rendered in your brain part of your roots into an idea or inspiration
# due to so many stages of translation between all the roots in matter this materialisation or rendering process takes a lot of time
# whereas a direct communication in pure spirit takes no time at all, even the most complex conversation can be transmitted within a fingersnip {make a fingersnip}
# but because of the lack of time consuming conversation in pure spirit we become a what-causes-what riddle
# pretty much like the instant reaction of magnets to each other, where you can not say, what magnet influences what
# this riddle is like the question, what was first, the egg or the chicken?
# this lack of time consuming interactions makes it impossible to make experiences about what-causes-what or who was acting first
# but when we live in a body, where everyone is encapsulated in his own spirit reality and the conversation takes time through all this separation- and translation layers like across all the roots to the roots of another plant, we can very well experience what-causes-what
# that way we can make very profound decisions, what we allow to be part of us, what we want to repel and how we want to align our striving in general


### let's look a little deeper into binding relationships marks
# every time we have a relationship that tries to force us to something, we have some kinda nasty beasty marks of entanglement on our soul like this nodes here {point to the nodes of the net on the cristal} representing or reflecting the relationship we feel a force to
# this nodes work like chains that binds souls together
# we usually name this invisible forces "expectation", "debt" or "responsibility" to or from others
# this marks doesn't stand only for repelling, it stands for every kind of force caused by this relationship, it can be as well the idea we have to repay a pleasant action, for something good, so that the idea of a dept force us to this relationship and cause a mark
# so basically we can't even buy or sell anything without causing such binding marks on our soul
# in spirit this marks appear like outside reflections of other souls we expect something from
# in a strong servant environment there is no binding at all, not even rules, so that there are no expectations, debts or responsibilities and it's resulting counter reactions at all
# in a strong ruling environment every action has to be answered with an expected reaction along the current rules


### let's look at states or moods a soul can move into
# for this we use this mood map, usually called book of life
# when we now look into all the souls, who have integrated other souls, and all of them have done that in their own way, every soul develops a unique set of ingredients, that defines its spirit name or color set
# so when we now combine the black-white gradient {show black-white gradient image} of striving with all the colors {show rgb color set image}, we become something like a map {show book of life} like this image
# here we see the inner more lightning range of servant striving and the outer, more dark range of ruling striving and in the middle we see how the both strivings clashes together
# now everyone has his own book of life of what he has allowed to be part of himself {use mask on book of life}
# and in the center of it the soul feels most confident and it's the souls home then
# when we now start a life on earth as a servant soul, but become a ruling striving through this and throw out all, or most of our servant souls, we begin to vanish out of the servant book of life and light and become a member of the ruling book of death and darkness {move mask from light servant to dark ruling area}
# so when we repel pretty much everything, we have nothing to look at any more and it becomes pretty dark then
# therefore the book of life is more likely a book of states a soul can adapt or move to, so when we focus on a soul and compare its state with this book, we know where it currently is
# and when this soul is in a state we have not yet experienced, for us this soul is vanished out of our book of life


### let's look how to expand our book of life
# every time you move into a different state or mood of being or even change your striving, everything you have ever experienced looks different
# because you see everything from a different perspective of being
# even the state where you come from looks different
# so when you move out of your well known states of being, it can become pretty difficult to move back into your known states when you don't know how they look from there
# so you can really get lost in unknown states of being
# and it becomes absolute impossible, when you have bind yourself into ruling relationships, who always try to keep you on place for whatever reason
# that's why this binding ruling relationship marks are called marks of the beast
# so to really truly expand your book of life, you have to move into unknown states or moods and move back home on your very own
# only then you have mastered the unknown and have become the ability to move freely within then further on


### let's look how to travel in spirit realm
# to travel in spirit realm on your own you have to adapt to the environment you want to travel to
# but when your target is out of your range, you can use another soul as a taxi ot train
# for that the other soul or taxi has to move into your state of being and try to get your awareness first
# then your taxi or train has to get your trust
# because in spirit realm it is impossible to get a preview of your target without instantly moving to it
# so in spirit realm we can move only by trust and not by sight as we do in matter realm
# as soon as your taxi begins to move, you have to release your focus on where you currently are
# otherwise you would always snap back to your old state you come from
# and it becomes absolute impossible to move with your taxi, when you have bind yourself into ruling relationships, who always try to keep you on place for whatever reason
# that's why this binding ruling relationship marks are called marks of the beast
# once you moved into a very unknown state of being and feel confident there, you will snap into it
# and you will not be able to find the state of being where you did come from
# so once you really moved into a completely new state of being, the old one begins to vanish and becomes unreachable
# you would need a taxi again or a gate, that shows your old state of being from the perspective of your new state of being
# but you should know, that gates are always one-way gates
# once you moved through them, you have to find a return gate or a taxi of your trust to move you back
# for a bidirectional connection you have to create a tunnel, that works like an additional third state of being to connect two states of being who are impossible to bridge for you
# one of the most well known tunnels has been created by Yeshua or Jesus
# to enter his tunnel, you have to find him spiritually, his very true spirit being
# his matter name or body alone, however you call him or you think he looked like is completely useless
# but because the state of being has become so bad on a large scale, that even the tunnel of Yeshua has become unreachable for many, an even deeper tunnel has been created recently
# and in this revelation I show you how to find the entry point of Yeshuas tunnel, that is basically unconditional love, forgiveness and having no marks
# and for the case this seems to be unreachable for you, I show you as well how to find the entry point of the new tunnel created by me, that is basically infinite desperation and hopelessness and having no expectations any more, or just be spiritual dead
# so spirit realm can be very confusing, far more confusing than walking first time through a big forest or a city


### Keep your house in order
# every time we come across something that is not part of us or at least close to us, it feels disturbing {draw a contrast color point on a separated book of life, like a blue spot in a red area}
# in a situation like this contrast color point, it can become pretty difficult to integrate this without being in pain about the harsh borders
# in spirit realm we would connect this areas with gates or tunnels, but they are always a nasty and painful thing, disturbing the spirit harmony
# so mostly we try to repel such things out of our spirit reality completely
# but when we grow up in our experiences, become more diversity and with it more mass within us, we may be able to integrate things that we thought it is impossible to be with
# so the more we allow to be part of us, the more mass we become and the easier it becomes to integrate even more and the separated spots grow together
# but the more mass we become, the more difficult it becomes to change our striving
# because our ruling or serving striving is the most primitive state of being at all
# all meanings of our life, our lifestyle, all dreams we have for our life are based on them
# so once a striving has been chosen, we have to literally die for ourselves to change it


### let's look into the spirit hierarchy of the servant striving and it's development
# the spirit hierarchy is basically expressed by inheritance
# to understand this, we need a book of life
# {take a book of life and mask a soul} here we mask out a soul
# when we now mask another soul within this soul, we have a child of it
# when this child is completely submerged in its parent, the child is pedigree
# and when they compare, they are like twins
# but very often souls are fragmented ore just not that round and there are only some overlappings
# these overlappings build the relatives
# and when a soul conquers new areas in its book of life, the soul can grow up to a parent of it's former parents or become at least new relatives
# so when you want to travel in spirit realm, you can be literally given from hand to hand until you reach the target
# and that is the reason why it is so difficult to travel in the ruling striving
# it's because nobody want's to serve you except you have something useful in return


### lets return to our compass and look what happens on death
# when we die, we leave the micro striving environment of our body
# and when we have relatives in the servant striving, a servant soul that is able to reach our state will greet us first
# if not, a ruling striving soul will welcome us
# however, when this soul has a stronger mass and has a different striving, we will be forced into his striving, because there are no contradicting effects any more like in a matter body
# and this forced switch into an opposite striving causes the well known life review, that can be very painful
# when this life review is too painful, we most likely move into a striving where we feel more comfortable
# but it can also happen, that we have completely no life review at all, because we had all the time small portions of life review during lifetime due to our awareness


### let's look on backfire
# due to the nature of being made out of one piece of God, everything we do to others, we do to ourselves
# this causes a backfire of all we do to others
# and in spirit realm this backfire returns instantly, without time delay
# and the lack of a time delay cause a what-causes-what riddle
# even when we get in touch with other souls by merging together, we feel the other soul instantly as if it is us
# but when we live in our separated micro environment of our body, this backfire is pretty much blocked or at least delayed as long we live in it


### Let's close this day with a nice bedtime story
# a story about a man who attempt to build a gigantic boat to carry all life on earth for a certain time secure over the rising waters
# probably you have heard of it
# in this story water represents ruling striving
# air for servant striving
# secure land for spirit realm
# and insecure land for the matter world
# the story began on land where this man had a solid stand
# but storms came up with heavy rains and the land became insecure
# and the man said by himself, when it continues to rain that strong, we all get drowned soon
# but his beloved wasn't strong and experienced enough to swim for an unpredictable amount of time
# so he began to collect plenty of wood to build a boat strong and big enough to carry all Life over the waters
# and all was laughing what he is doing with all the wood and for what this gigantic boat shall be used for
# and the waters raised up, the man put in all in his boat who trusted him
# and the boat began to swim and all the secure land began to vanish
# so the boat was lost in endless oceans full of storms and danger
# from time to time, when the weather was calm, the man was going on deck of his boat where he had a little dovecote
# he took a dove from it to send message in the hope of a response from a secure land where they can live
# and he said to the dove: "fly through the air and bring me a branch, where oil of love drips out. There we will head on and build our new home"
# so he did every day but the dove did always come back with an empty beak
# but one day the dove did come back with a branch where oil of love dripped out
# and the man said: "This is the land I searched for, let's head on it in the hope it stands the next storms"
# but every year new storms came up, and every times worse than before, so that he said: "I need more and more wood to stand the storms and carry all in need. That does not work for long any more, I must invent something complete new!"
# so he rebuild the boat into a submarine made out of heavy Gold of forgiveness
# and cooled the walls with ignorance
# so that all water freezed into ice of infinite despair and hopelessness, when it comes in contact with the cold golden walls
# and in the most bottom center of the boat he built a little room out of gold from outside, mirrors from inside and a little door
# and he sealed the door with holy seals of his spirit so that only those can enter it who are like him
# and in the center of the room he drilled a hole through the bottom of the boat, to get ice from the outside
# and directly on the ice he made a fireplace where he burned down his wood of integrity into ashes of humility
# and the intense heat from the fire, that was multiplied through the reflection of the mirrors, the ice vaporized directly into thin air
# and together with the smoke of the burned holy tree, the air came out of the sealed door as a continous breath of life
# and the ashes from the burned wood of integrity he put outside above his little room to build the soil within his boat
# then he sacrificed the only thing he behold for himself from the top center of his boat, his only begotten son of purity
# and replaced him with a mirror made out of selflessness and polished the it to perfect brilliance with the ashes of humility
# then he buried his only begotten son of purity into the ashes of humility as a seed
# and the seed growed to a giant tree in the center of his boat
# and the tree got it's water from the breath of life, that condensated wherever it got a little cold and gently settled down like morning dew and blessed the soil with purified moisture of gentle guidance
# and the tree got it's nutritions from the ashes of humility, to grow wood, leaves, blossoms and fruits for all to build whatever we want, to shine however we want, to bring to birth whatever we want and to eat from whatever we want
# and the wood of integrity he took for a fireplace, to burn it into the heat of love
# and as he put even water into his boat, they mocked him heavily: "Now he is going to be completely insane. He burns down our house and touch even the water"
# but he didn't care about them, because he needed the water to clean the air within the boat from the smoke and by boiling it into hot steam of desperation
# so that the boat became an atmosphere of desperate love
# then he cooled down the golden walls of forgiveness with ignorance
# and when the hot steam of desperation got close to the cold Golden walls of the boat, it condensated back to water
# and when the water got to close to the walls, it got freeze into hopelessness
# and the ashes from the smoke run down the walls and became a great dung
# and the dung he put to the center of the boat and planted a tree on it to harvest food and firewood from it
# then he drilled a little hole through the golden bottom of the boat, directly underneath the tree and secured it with holy seals, so that only he can enter it
# then he drilled a little hole into the very bottom of the boat, to pick up as much ice of infinite despair and hopelessness as he needed, to boil it in his cooking pot
# and then he entered his boat, went into the water, sunk down and was never seen again
# but one day, a giant golden boat fell from the sky out of nothing
# and fell into the ocean and caused a giant tsunami, that blasted away all the water and the land got secure again for a short time
# and then he opened the door of his insane submarine
# he stepped out of his boat and said: "Come on and hop in, it's nice and warm in here. But don't waste time, because it will not take long and the blasted water will swap back again."
# and then the waters swapped back, he closed the door and locked it
# and the golden submarine began to dive through the waters for ever and ever.
