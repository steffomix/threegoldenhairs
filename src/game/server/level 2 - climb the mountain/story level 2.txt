### In spirit realm the enlightment express the striving or the awareness, that everything is a reflection of yourself and to what level you allow all this reflections to be part of yourself
# but when we allow all to be part of yourself, we nullify even the striving against each other and that would mean the deletion of all existence
# or to be aware the we are, we need something to know that we are not, which causes the contradicting strivings
# so the more we get aware what we are and what we are not, the stronger and harder the borders are going to get against each other
# but there is a certain point, where borders become so strong, that they have to shift into a new state, a state of being infinite strong
# at this state of having an infinite strong border, it can not be crossed any more without going through the state of something infinity, where we have to left behind everything that belongs to our current striving to be able to enter the other striving
# so the harder the borders get, the smaller get the eye of the needle we have to go through


### In spirit realm we express our mood or our current state of being in colors
# so we see these colors by feeling them
# that means that it is impossible to hide your true mood or current state in any way
# and we can move within our states as we want, but there is a certain range or color-range of states where we feel the most confident
# and when we now combine the enlightment of our striving with our most confident color-range, we have the place of our home in the spirit realm
# but when we move into states where we feel unpleasant, our colors begin to wave and flicker after a while and everybody can see you feel uncomfortable


### In spirit realm we express our general behavior with our appearance or outer form or the clothes we wear and that can be anything
# and there is a certain range of behaviors or forms we feel the most confident
# but the more we move out of our most confident behavior, the more our outer appearance begin to wave and flicker up to becoming like a storm of destruction
# when we now put many storms together, we easily slide into a what-causes-what riddle so that the storms make themself worse and it becomes obvious that the only way to calm down the storms is by separating them from each other
# and that is what the servant striving did all the way, beginning on an atomic scale
# bit the stubborness of the ruling striving had no problem to abuse all this attempts to make their storms against each other even worse
# with the help of the servants and the weak neutrals they became able to build structures surrounding them and hide behind it, so complex that they became like a walking universe
# and with the overall entanglement between the strivings the whole existence of God was going to end up in this storms
# but it turned out, that when you let the storms go their way, so that they crush and pressure themself into a state of infinte despair, they become calm and with it they become able to return to their place in spirit realm
# there was just one problem, someone has to go into that state an pick them up there
# it's a problem because you have to enter the ruling striving from the outside into its worse excessions and ceep holy your servant striving within yourself to be able to return to it
# to make even that worse, you have to stand both contradicting strivings within yourself and become like a double sided sword
# and this can only be archived by switching between this states over and over again and dive a little deeper into the darknes every time and a little higher into the light to not get attracted by the darkness and always stay in balance
# but switching between this states means to go through the eye of the needle over and over again
# and that means to get crushed, humbled, ripped appard and die for yourself over and over and over again


### The first idea to calm the stormy souls is by ruling them into a unified behavior
# we want to call this technic of ruling into a unified behavior "religion"
# but due to its ruling nature it tends to build breakouts like branches growing from a trunk
# and it is just a matter of time, until so many branches have grown, that they begin to clash against each other
# so we have to cut of some branches every year to keep the growing tree in a healthy state
# but every year the tree becomes bigger, more complex and with it more difficult to differ the branches between those you want to cut off and those you want to keep
# so that there will come a certain point where we have to make a decision
# let the tree grow to become sick at the whole and die at the end^ or cut of all branches except the source, the trunk
# the trunk is the source, and the source is the spirit of heaven, and the spirit of heaven is the flour we make our bread from, and the bread is the behaivior, and the behavior ist the clothes we wear


### let's prepare ourself for baking some white bread
# first we have to clean up the citchen and put off all the old clothes, to make sure that nothing unpure comes in contact with the flour from source
# at next we have to calm down and fall in love with the very fluffy spirit of heaven to make sure we really accept it and do not repell anything
# after we have recieved the spirit of heaven, we have to lock up the kitchen and keep it holy that way to make sure it doesn't get messed up with anything unpure


### let's go calm and take a look at fear, expectations and predictions
# fear is a result of predictions we make, and at the same time we caculate an expectation that is different to our prediction
# but this can only be done with our brain, our soul can not do that
# that's the reason for the timeless feeling of eternity while being in pure spirit realm, but there is plenty of time
# so the first thing we have to do, to recieve flour from heaven, is to not predict anything, but just trust
# with our brain we move by predictions that provides some kinda sight, but in spirit we move by trust, what means to get in contact with everything - without protection
# so for walking by trust you need boldness and for walking by sight you need armor
# but with armor we isolate us from our environment
# and because everything is life, the armor can become so big and comllex, that it creates a reality on it's own, like a virtual reality
# but to make it even worse, you can surround your virtual reality with yet another virtual reality and create layers of protection that way
# and the only reason for doing so, is because of the effects of repelling relationships to other souls, we repell by judging them out of our life
# but that is impossible, because the so called others are just another aspect or looking eye of ourself
# so by repelling others we try to cut something from ourself out, but that is - as said - impossible
# and to make it even worse, the pain caused by repelling parts of ourself is without timedelay and appears like a what-causes-what riddle, so that you can not say who or what causes it


### let's look a little deeper into love and forgiveness
# love is a result of allowing others to get unprotected in contact with ourself,  to be part of ourself and to care for them as if it is ourself
# so with love we give others room within ourself for the sake of ourselfs room
# with love we give something to others and don't want anything in return, there is not even an idea of repay for what we have given
# and with forgiveness we do exactly the same but in the opposide direction
# so if someone take anything from us or hurt us in any way, we do not want to do anything in return, we completely do not react, even more, we give him room where he can express his style of life in full quality
# the only difference between love and forgiveness is, that with forgiveness we move by trust and with love we move by sight
# because with forgiveness we have no choice, we have to take it in the way it comes, but with love we can choose when and what we are going to do


### let's move a bit in love by sight
# for love the servant way imagine it is early in the morning, the sun is croaching like a thief underneath the horizon and the morning clouds are gently settling down to bless the weak at first and the useless the most whereas the great have deep roots to gather their blessings by themself, so that everything can grow up in peace and comfort safely
# for love the ruling way you summon dark clouds of heavy rain to break the weak and drown the useless, you summon fiery praying storms of judgement and heavy winds of hatred to blow all away that dares to be greater than you, so that everything get destroyed in performance and competition safely
# but in forgiveness, the sun is shining on bright midday on everyone and everything no matter what and don't cares what is going on
# so you hopefully see, how easy it is to slide into unwanted weather conditions
# servant love has no rules, so don't follow them or you get drawn down into their environment with its stormy weather conditions
# servant love has no expectations of a repay that cause beasty marks on your soul, so don't follow them or you get drawn down into their environment with its stormy weather conditions
# but when you love the storm, when you love hatred and judgement, when you love performance and competition, then you know how and where to go






















### Climbing the mountain is all about changing your striving from ruling to servant
# that means, that our earthly environment will reakt on the changing rule/serve balance and tries to reorganize and rebalance itself which usualy works out chaotic
# this is because all life decisions are based on this most grounded striving, and when it changes, everything in your life changes
# so what you need the most on those changes is to stay calm, no matter what
# because every little change in the striving of one soul moves all its relationships into a new, often onknown state, to which they have to get used to, so that the overall environment becomes stable again
# imagine a pot of water (ruling striving) we want to turn into air (servant striving) on a heat source
# we can do this quik with much heat and much violence or slow with low heat and low violence
# {use compass and magnet} but the biggest obstacle on switching in your striving is the zero point or suizide point of deepest depressions , where literaly *all* your previous dreams for your life will break and die
# don't underestimate this zero point of striving, it is one of the most horrible things a soul can experience
# it is like walking through an eye of a needle, where only the raw naked soul can walk through
# you will have to left behind all your meanings of life to be able to walk through this eye of a needle into a complete new meaning of life


### Let's talk about religions
# Does your Religion rule or serve you?
# Understand the meaning of Religions as Houses where you can get or give something needful for your or others Path
# Religions should not block the path, they should not be a trap like a sticky or backstabbing flycatching plant
# Religions should not abuse their members to make themself great, because in return the members wield this greatness and walk in vanity, and walking in vanity in return denounces others.
# Does your Religion give you a backup and help making your own experience, or is it more like do and don't do this and that?
# Rethink the relationship of you and Religions: 
# They should be like Flowers aside your Path and we should be like Bees who have a nice flyby, to gather nourishments and enrich its diversity and beauty
# because by doing so, we quickly experience, that every single being, every soul or shard of God is a religion in itself


### Religions are like clothes we wear, to protect us against direct and raw spirit experiences
# but this clothes can get that strong and dense, that we completely loose the connection to our origin in spirit
# But when we want to go in direct contact again, we have to take off all those clothes and go naked
# To be naked means to be unprotected, to go in direct touch with our origin, there is nothing in between
# Being naked means to be highly vulnerable for everything that touches us
# Taking off our religious clothes means to open all doors and windows for a direct touch with spirit
# and what we come across in this direct touch, depends highly on our striving


### Let's talk about fear
# fear is a coverword for unpleasant expectations like love is for caring
# and expectations are a result of unpleasant predictions
# predictions can only made by our matter brain that always tries to make us feel confident to protect us that way from unpleasant experiences
# Spirit can not expect or predict the future
# In spirit you live in the now, what produces the timeless feeling
# but it's not timeless, it's just the absense of the ability of making predictions 
# Spirit will never have any expectation *against* you
# spirit always try to deal with the situation that just is now


### Focusing on Predictions and Expectations shutdown the connection to spirit
# with focusing on your brains work you block yourself out from spirit connections and any kind of help from there.
# with expectations, and in consequence with ruling commands against others you instantly(!) kick yourself out of any heavenly connection
# understand the life in spirit as a lifestyle in-the-now without any kind of predictions, expectations and its resulting Fear


### let's look into the difference between loving and forgiving
# when we love, we give something and whant nothing in return
# when we forgive, something has been taken from us and we want nothing in return
# loving and forgiving is completely the same thing, the same medal just watched from the other side
# when we comfort someone and want nothing in return is the same as get hurt and forgive
# the idea of repay is a pure ruling behavior
# and every force against any relationship of us, even the idea of it cause a beasty mark of the beast on our soul and makes us and that can not be in the pure servant heaven


### Let's look into the two sides of a thief
# nobody shows us better how to serve the right way than a thief
# thiefs don't go for attention and they are always very aware of their environment and what is going on there
# When recognize behaviors like stealing and being a hindrance as just one side of the same medal and turn it around, we have the common behavior of heaven thats only love


### Let's look at the thief in larger scale, where he causes a what-causes-what riddle
# Imagine it is night, just before the sun is rising
# when then you go outside and touch the gras, it may be all wet, but there was no rain
# that is how to serve the right way
# not like morning clouds, gently settling down and bless the lands without causing any attention for themself even ifvit sounds nice
# but like the invisible moisture in the air, gently condensating its wet blessings where it has gone a little cold and dry
# morning clouds ore only needed when the sun comes too strong after a long night
# but don't summon clouds for rain, that is not needed, not even wanted
# big old trees can take strong rains, even wild storms without get hurt or even break into the other striving, but they have their roots deep in the source of live and don't need clouds or rain
# The old trees draw their water from their deep springs and evaporate it into their surroundings


### Let's figure out what sin is
# there is only one sin and that is to do things they do not belong to what you strive to
# but there is one sin that can not be forgiven by others, and that is what you can only forgive yourself
# and whatever happened to you or whatever you caused in your life, there is no duty for repair and there is no duty for repay at all
# to repeat that: there is no duty like that at all!
# everybody has the opportunity to forgive and a servant being will allways do that without a question, because it is his nature of being
# the only one who will never forgive is a ruling being, because it is his nature of being



### Lets reconnect to spirit by fasting us out of the brain
# {take large net} look at this net, that represents our brain or matter body in general and my hands and fingers represents our soul or spirit in general
# now I show you a short exercise, how to literaly rupture {make forcing moves against the net} the net with your willpower from you soul
# for this we have to be fully awake and our eyes open, don't close your eyes
# now we fix a high contrast point for a view seconds and try to think totally nothing with all force you can bring up and try to reakt to totally nothing, whatever happens in our mind or environment
# the only thing we reakt to, is when we be asked for help or any service of love
# do this in the beginning not longer the 10 seconds, then relax for a view seconds and repeat it
# you will get pretty much tired on this and all your relationship marks, {add some sticks and dirt to the net} your matter bounds and addictions to matter world can become awake extremly strong, which is the normal due to the enhanced awareness of the spirit reality
# so whatever you get aware of uncomfortable things doesn't mean it is bad at all, it does mean that your relationship to it makes you feel uncomfortable, therefore don't judge it away, instead work on your relationship to it
# however, you can get so tired on this exercise, that the need for sleep becomes overhelming, as well as your need for matter addictions, but try to withstand them as long as you can
# remember that all the addictions and habits to matter are meaningless and only belongs to your brain, the only thing that really matters is where you strive to with your heart and you don't feel any hurting force in your relationships, so that it is all forgiven
# that you are humble and have a pure heart without a mark, where unconditional love drips out
# later do that exercise up to 10 minutes at morning and evening and you will get an insane spirit willpower in addition you will need to stand the upcoming spiritual storms caused by distorted strivings in your matter body



### Fasting effects
# imagine you strech you away from a computer screen to open the window a little
# the first effect  impression is like fresh air, more life energy and everything becomes a little easier
# afterwards you may have wierd undescribable sensations or tend to a little more to daydreaming
# note that we have bypassed or brain to render spirit sensations automatic into matter impressions, so we have to do this by ourself manualy with our day-awake awarenes
# therefore the tasks for our brain literaly doubles and we will need more sleep than usual
# so, whatever your brain renders to you on visual or sound impressions automatic, don't look at it, that is not your target of raw spirit
# raw spirit impressions are always absolute undescribeable and frightening in the beginning and you will need a lot of experiences to get used to it and to translate them into matter images, which describe those impressions
# these impressions most likely are like: sense the life in plants, sense the soul of an animal or a human but you always have to look at it
# later on you can sense the spirit from departed and depending on your striving you can also come in direct contact with angels from heaven
# later on your nightly dreaming will completely stop, your sleep is then like a fingersnip, because everything you need from spirit, you become on bright daylight directly


### Let's learn how to combine spirit impressions with our daily doings
# remember that heaven never commands you or make you feel bad, instead heaven will always try to explain you how things work to become a better understanding on which you can make better decisions in the future and as a little addition on top of this you will always get a little loving touch to not feel shattered on this
# heaven teaches you things by providing a view on things you want to understand from several different positions or angles
# So it's pretty much like you do all day, when you walk around a thing to examine it
# what you do with this knowledge afterwards is completely on you
# that means, when you do things that were not so nice, an angel may come and explain you what you are going to loose in the most kind and loving way, but please don't abuse their good will ;) {show warning finger like for kids}
# what we do now is some kinda dry run for life in spirit
# and we do this with drawing in the most easiest way, so the less experienced you are in drawing the better
# with this we learn how to differ brain thoughts from spirit impressions while being fully awake, so it’s an extension of the meditation you should do before for a view seconds
# You can use any material that leaves visible trails like flat stones to scratch on, Sand to draw in with your finger or a stick, or modern with paper and pencil
# Don’t show anyone your draws easily, because it’s an expression of your very personal conversation with hopefully your *higher* self
# While drawing don’t wait for commands, that will never happen, heaven never command anyone # just keep moving as you are used to do
# Do the same way your in your normal daily doings
# Imagine to move a standing rock is much more difficult that giving an already moving rock a striving into a direction, that's the way you should do it
# Don’t focus on a successful image, that's not the target of the exercise
# While drawing your brain tries constantly to predict what that it could go to be and tries to takeover control of your drawing process
# Don’t let your brain take control - that’s the first and hardest part of the exercise
# Put yourself into a feeling like a humble child, listening to loving parents
# it may feel like angelique beings trying to comfort you, but you are completely unable to understand anything, just go into it and enjoy this feeling
# To learn the angelique language of heaven is the second part of the exercise
# For a starting point: It feels like a very gentle mild warm summerwind you don’t know where it comes from, nor where it blows to
# But with practice the impression of the gentle “wind” becomes the same way meaningful contours as your drawings
# Do the same way in your daily doings, that become more secure and knowing what you are doing
# With more practice your learn to articulate some basic “spirit words” on your own and learn to “speak” this heavenly language directly with your soul and no odd brain thoughts in between
# Learn the heavenly language pretty much like babies learn to speak
# It will may feel like a dream, like dreaming and being awake at the same time
# To learn to establish this kinda connection in normal daily life is the third and final part of the exercise
# You daily doing, thinking and talking becomes angelique and with it you will have to learn to keep things holy, to not throw the spirit of heaven on the street, where it get trampled down and cause nothing than wickedness against the holy spirit
# So don't be the cause for wickedness against the spirit of heaven, learn to keep the spirit of heaven holy


### Baking white bread - or learn to render holy spirit
# when white flour (pure spirit from heaven) comes into your life (your water), don’t haste or you mess it all into waste
# learn to stand this intense impressions like a rock - or like a strong vessel you can trust, that it keeps things holy and don’t throw everything on the street you have put in
# strong means integrity, integrity you get through standing suffering without turning against it through ruling
# Let your received white flour settle down into your life until its complete diluted and seems to be vanished, which can take years
# Now you are fully back in matter reality and should try to grasp your experiences from this side of reality and put all together you received
# Your loose flour has turned into dough or pastry, you can handle way better now
# Don’t wait too long now and don’t mess around by sharing with others, because by doing so your dough get infected by stranger influences and will turn into sourdough
# The state of raw dough is the most sensitive, where you have to learn to keep things pure and holy (untouched)
# Often your dough is to large for one portion and you will have to cut it into pieces you will have to sort and bring into a meaningful order by hand
# Every time you work on it, get a taste of it and check if it fits to the original spirit you have recieved or if it is somehow distorted and feel uneven
# Go in love with it again (bake it) and try to put the dough into words and analogies that describe your spirit impressions at best
# even during this process you will have to check it's taste and if anything is uneven over and over again
# After this baking process let your breads settle down a while until your loving heat has gone out
# The loving heat to your bread makes you getting hurt when other deny or denunciate it - so let it cool down before you serve it
# Let it completely cool down before you cut it in slices of words for serving, otherwise it is to cross from the outside and too sticky from the inside and you become an emotional mess of missunderstandings when you try to cut it in this too fresh state


### Let's reach the timberline of the mountain where we get in contact with the naked meaningless rock, the raw integrity of life, where the air becomes so thin, that we barely can breath
# between the timberline and the snowline we stand in the zero point of striving, where everything comes into balance but whoever stays here becomes a dead observer
# so let's stay here a bit and observe...
# The Integrity of eternity is the man's part and the beauty of meaning is the woman's part
# The man's part is to keep holy his meaning of life
# When the Integrity of forgiveness becomes too weak to stand the beauty of love, it easily turns into judgement against the love to reduce its beauty by ruling it
# But Love has no rules and should never have
# And by this the man is moving his servant strength from inside into a ruling outside and that way  things are going to get worse and worse
# the Woman in reaktion moves her beauty from her inside to her outside of ruling or more likely deceiving behavior
# but this interactive relationship between man an woman is a spirit what-causes-what riddle, so that nobody can say who caused it
# So that there is no other way out of it than unconditional, that means unruled and unjudged forgiveness
# however, this moving into outside judgememt and ruling caused an isolation against each other
# and the isolation caused the matter world and with it a disconnection from the spirit of heaven
# but the spring of life in heaven was also disconnected from the water source


### Let's go a little higher to reach the snowline where everything becomes bright white
# and when we look down into all the distorted life, suffering in hope and despair of its ruling nature, unable to step over this dead rock into the servant heaven
# the snow on the mountain high need the ruling water from the deep to transform it into servant snowflakes of heaven to enrich its beauty
# but every time they clush together, the waters isolate themself more and more, because it can not understand the beauty of heaven and therefor every time it becomes harder to get a little water from the deep
# so heaven send a servant snowflake direct into the ruling waters, but he became a distinct welcome greeting and his harvest was poor
# but the snowflake learned his lession risked his life by using the waters isolation as well and dive as deep as possible to find a way to get the water from underneath of it, what means to loose connection to its source of heaven so that there was always a chance to get drown and die in the waters



#################
#################






, or the Meaning becomes too strong, we can either suppress the meaning or strengthen the Integrity
# Well, Man (Integrity) tried everything to hide his weakness by suppressing his meaning (Woman) and moved his strength from his servant inside to his ruling outside
# The more weak a man is on his Inside, the more power he need on his outside, he moves his mass (throwing out his life experience) from inside to outside - the Ark breaks

# This process or cause is a spirit what-cause-what riddle, there is no one to sue for, neither man or woman
# That way both destroy their Inside, move it to the outside, bury them self underneath it and get lost in it, the Ark sinks and all life experience in it drowns
# There is nothing you can do against it except knowing that this can happen and knowing how to fix that
# To fix that you need Knowledge, which is a result of experience and experience is a result of sinning and forgiving
# Balance in love can not be succeeded, it can only be choosen as lifestyle where you have to care about each other all the way along




# and when we look ahead, even higher, we can allready guess the snowline, where the bright white flour, the servant spirit of heaven comes from
# and when we look down into all the distorted life, suffering in hope and despair of its ruling nature, unable to step over this dead rock into the servant heaven
# the snow on the mountain high need the ruling water from the deep to transform it into servant snowflakes of heaven and enrich its beauty
# but every time they clush together, the waters isolate themself more and more, because it can not understand the beauty of heaven and therefor every time it becomes harder to get a little water from the deep
# so heaven send a servant snowflake direct into the ruling waters, but he became a distinct welcome greeting and his harvest was poor
# but the snowflake learned his lession and adapted to the waters environment by using its isolations
# but wearing an isolation means to loose connection to its source of heaven so that there was always a probability to turn into water, get lost and die



### Balance Integrity and Meaning



### Let's build a bridge
# 
# and when we look down at the naked rock of integrity, we see it is completely meaningless on its own
# but how to bring together the harsh rock of integrity with the loose spirit of heaven?
# 
# 

# We now can look down to all the grown and distorted meanings of life, where everyone runs criss-cross in circles
# We are standing on the bare naked integrity of everything, which is the purity of eternal life
# But integrity on its own has no meaning - and meaning on its own has no integrity
# The only way that integrity becomes a meaning, is to sacrifice a part of it, like to sacrifice a bone of your skeleton of integrity
# The only way for meaning of life to become integrity is to sacrifice a part of it, like to sacrifice a part of your freedom
# The sacrifice itself has to be like a connector between integrity and meaning...
# ...has to integrate and stand the contradicting properties of heaven and hell in one being, like an Ark containing all life experience without breaking
# ... has to be a being because there is nothing that is not a being
# … has to be as small (humble) as possible to not be a hindrance for the beauty and freedom of the freedom as well as not being an destructive curse for the integrity of eternal life
# ...to be a Son of God as well as a Son of Men, to be accepted for both
# …to be known, that everyone can become this and therefore this son is nothing special or “more” than anyone




### Meet your higher self means to surpass and integrate the spirit of Jesus
# surpassing doesn’t mean to become greater
# surpass means to bring your ruling striving to a halt like slowing down a rotating wheel until it stands still and turn it in the opposite direction, into a servant striving.
# Surpassing Jesus means to go through him like going through a door and truly enter and live in his servant kingdom, to enter heaven
# That’s because it makes no sense to just repeat a coming of Jesus
# --- Tell the Story of being in sync with Jesus and the poor jung man who could not see him ---
# Spirit never does the exact same thing twice, because you change by growing with every experience which makes a repeat impossible


### The meaning of Yeshua or Jesus explained on the Staff of Life
# The outer wrapping represents the soft expressions of the meaning of life, which protecting seal is a rope of love
# Don’t focus too much on the outer wrapping (matter world and body) or it goes too thick and turns into a dark dungeon of death
# The inner Trunk represents the integrity of eternal life
# On this Trunk is a little scripture that curves gently around it like a snake, that has three sections: A tail (first day), a body (second day) and a head (third day)
# Compare the Crystal (basic Soul), the Staff, every being and even Jesus as the same
# This staffs (or poles) striving was upside down as well as the scripture all the time until recently (The dove brought the branch)
# Recently it has becomes a little striving up and we begin to refuse to react on bad actions with bad responses and try to forgive and heal instead.


### What Jesus really did and does right now (Use hands to show)
# How Jesus sinks underneath hell and said “I’m a Son of God”
# How Hell killed him
# How Jesus keep awareness until near zero striving
# How both Jesus and his Bride (you all) signal (right now) to look and strive to heaven (are you ready for the final shot?)
# Jesus pours out his holy spirit over all mankind - It’s all like making love
# (more deeply later)

### Show the (Staff) Scripture of life - The sacrifice
# Show the scripture on the Staff and ask if you can accept this sacrifice of your freedom, if this is something you can accept to strive to


### Show the NDE and what it means to look in the right direction
# Head on Rest-Area with a little Cabin (hut), some tables and banks
# three paths
# 1 up to hotels, sports and extinct dino footprints in a stone quarry
# 2 straight across a bridge where a little pond turns into a little brook, to a woodman's hut, a nice big gras with a big fireplace in the center and banks around, taps for water supply and toilets are even there
# 3 deep down to a little spring of water, coming out of the rock, that contains much iron and tastes like rusty nails, a even smaller path to the brook
# When you can see only the outer being of a simple man, messing around with water, you can go back to the bank at the irony spring, sit down and think about what you have done wrong
# Turn around and see what you get, when you look in the wrong direction
# You see a dead man on a cross looking like a joke, meaningless snippets of scriptures too bad for the bin and some other crappy stuff laying around like stupid trash.


### Love has no rules or the trap of too much knowledge
# with too much knowledge all your attempts to become more loving or forgiving easily becomes a selfish touch and nullify or even worse results into the exact opposide
# its like heading to the tip of a mountain, the closer you come, the more difficult it becomes to not look at yourself
# it helps for a while to make yourself smaller and smaller, to become more and more humble
# but to really reach the top of the mountain you have to completely nullify yourself, you have to die for yourself
# this death is the point of complete servant striving, the eye of the needle you have to gothrough
# only at this point, in being one with the spirit of heaven you can experience the pure meaning of servant striving
# you become one with jesus and fully integrate his being
# this full integration is beyond believe, beyond being excited and even beyond love
# by walking through jesus you get aware that there is something way brighter than conditionless love


### a deeper look into a divine year (or the meaning of divine love)
# Let go all fruits of Love
# Let go all leaves of wisdom
# Let go all Branches of striving
# Let go your roots of life experiences
# Let go Your Bark of Protection
# Let dry the rest of you, the trunk, from all life sensations
# welcome your meaning of life
# Gently get in touch with your meaning of life
# Let the meaning of life suround you like a golden silky scarf
# Slowly go in love with each other and become all gold
# go in love with each other and become bright white like a sun
# Enjoy unity
# Enjoy oneness
# Enjoy the love of pure divine life sensation
# Let the holy spirit pour out over all flesh
# Enjoy the loving presence of each other
# Slowly let cool down your love to each other and become all gold again
# Gently get appart
# Enjoy the silky touch of your meaning of life
# Seal and keep holy your meaning of life by dressing up a new bark
# Let grow new roots of life experiences
# Let grow new branches of striving
# Let grow new leaves of wisdom
# Let grow new fruits of love
#
# {Fold this note gentle and put it to your heart pocket} "This is only for those who are willing to follow me"
