### the most primitive states of being are the ruling striving and its counterpart, the servant striving
# in the state of servant striving we dissolve in general awareness into our environment like a drop of water dissolves into an ocean
# or like two clean and undistorted mirrors who are looking into themselves
# and this deep reflection cause the impression of light
# and in this light we get at first aware of everything, that is close to our state of being or have similar colors and enlightenment
# and the more we dissolve in general awareness, the more we get aware of colors, who are unlike us
# and we do this until we got aware of something we want to interact with
# and to be able to interact, we focus or collapse our awareness back and solid into an expression of ourselves
# in the colors or state of being we want to be
# in an appearance, that describes our behavior
# so the reason of interaction is like a mark, that grabs and holds our awareness as long as we allow it
# but when we get stuck in the awareness of a mark, we can not dissolve into a general awareness anymore
# and our mark or the reason that grabs our awareness turns into a mark of a beast
# because the reason of our awareness tries to hold us focussed to the reason
# and when we can not dissolve into general awareness anymore, everything becomes dark around us
# and when many souls get stuck in a state of collapsed awareness, they move into an forced relationship against each other
# and with the forced relationship they create the ruling environment
# and the only way to become some distant and freedom in a ruling environment is by repelling others
# but by reppelling everything becomes even darker
# so the only way to come together again in a ruling environment is by setting up rules of general or uniformed behavior
# and uniformed behavior means uniformed appearance
# but setting up general behaviors suppress the need of freedom even more
# and the suppressed freedom causes hatred against the suppressors and the suppressing environment
# and the suppressors try to suppress the hatred with judgement and even more rules
# so everything becomes more and more tight and compressed
# and everything begins to move against each other in a competitive way
# so that only who performs the most hatred against others becomes the most freedom
# and those who are not strong enougth or just refuse to hate and judge are crushed down into a pitchblack bottomless pit of infinite despair and hopelessness or second death
# from where nobody ever returned on his own
# until latelely
# and that changes everything
# so this day we learn how to move out of the bottomless pit, back into the heavens we once come from
# but because it's a long road, we need some food
# so let's move into the kitchen and make some white bread


### let's clean up the kitchen first to receive white flour first
# in spirit we walk by trust, but our kitchen, that's our brain 
# but our brain works only by predictions and expectations
# and when our expectations don't match our predictions, our brain uses judgement to fix that
# and when we can't fix the reason, that causes the missmatch, we are going to repel or destroy the reason
# and when we can't destroy or repel the reason, we experience fear
# so, as long we focus on our brain activity, we can not move into spirit
# but we don't need to keep the kitchen clean for long, because in spirit informations are transported allways within a fingersnip
# and we don't have to wish anything or pray for it, because in spirit we walk by trust
# so just trust
# the only thing we can do in addition, is attracting love
# and nothing attracts love more than it's counterpart, despair
# so feel free to move into a state of despair
# but keep in mind, that your matter body environment don't like to be in despair and will get sick on it after a while
# so don't abuse despair as an love attractor


### let's create a spirit environment if not already created
# well, this is really the easiest of all
# for love the servant way just imagine it is early in the morning, the sun is croaching like a thief underneath the horizon and the morning clouds are gently settling down to bless the weak at first and the useless the most whereas the great and strong have deep roots to gather their blessings by themself, so that everything can grow up in peace and comfort safely
# for love the ruling way just you summon dark clouds for heavy rain to break the weak and drown the useless, you summon fiery praying storms of judgement and heavy winds of hatred to blow all away that dares to be greater than you, so that everything get destroyed in performance and competition safely
# but in forgiveness, the sun is shining on bright midday on everyone and everything no matter what
# that's it, easy as that
# but because it is so easy, let's repeat it with some nice images
# {show images from ezekiel chapter one and repeat}
# just if you wonder, where the eyes are, you are one of them


### let's learn to shutdown the brain for just a moment
# to make sure we receive our flour directly into the kitchen or brain of being up and awake
# we have to be completely awake and have to keep our eyes open
# now we are looking for a high contrast point to look at
# something like a bright spot on a dark background or something we hold in our hand, so that all behind blurs, because it is more far away
# and we can even use just our finger
# now we try to think nothing, don't even have any emotion
# and we do that with all willpower we can bring together for at least 10 seconds, but not longer than 10 minutes
# and we can do it as if you are lifting heavy weights, like in regular muscle training
# or like a woman who has labor contractions and trys to push her baby out
# so as said, the willpower you bring up is all that counts
# and you need to bring up that willpower from your soul
# so don't try to think to think nothing, that does not work
# when you are successful, you should become a little dizzy
# and you may even feel, that your spirit environment change a little
# and after a while you will have hard times to stay awake, because the need for sleep becomes overhelming
# and when you have problems with addictions or attractions of any kind, they will become very intense
# because you try to rip them off like a tape from the skin
# so addictions will become overhelming temporarily
# if so, just try to withstand as long as you can, before moving into hatred or judgement against your self
# and when you can't withstand any more or fall asleep, it's ok, nobody cleans a complete house in one strike
# and when you fell asleep and awake, you can be breathless or like under shock, because you died for a little moment
# but you mostly will not instantly remember what you have experienced, because you brain needs time to render or translate your spirit experience into a matter story or images from where you can translate back it's meaning
# because in spirit we are only meaning and have to express or dress it into a colorful form with a behavior
# but in matter it's the opposite, the meaning is hidden under countless expression layers
# so the only way to back to spirit is to break through all this layers
# but when you have no idea, what the difference is between words and meanings, you will barely bring you willpower from you soul to work and quickly move into hatred and judgement instead
# and yes, you can completely disconnect from your body and die that way


### let's look how we look in spirit and what angels are
# {use mirror on mirror} for this we put two mirrors against each other
# and at one of them we remove a little from it's reflection layer to look through
# when the mirrors are flat, paralel undistorted and clean, we can see a vast amount of reflections
# and all this reflections are your spirit eyes, who are actually angels of you
# so the better your inner mirror works, the brighter becomes your spirit vision
# for example, when you look to much on yourself by putting this mirrors close together, you reduce your spirit vision
# or when they are not parallel, you turn into a sideway
# and a sideway is like a branch growing on a tree in the servant striving or like a side-root in the ruling striving
# but there is no way to make the mirrors complete pure, because you would delete the observer that way
# and without an observer everything disappears into nothingness
# so the cause for all existence and all the mess that comes with it afterwards is the very first observer itself


### let's look what has changed in our kitchen
# when or brain workout was successful, we have caused some ruptures into the global spirit environment we belong to
# and through this ruptures we will have new kind of sensations we have to get used to
# and our brain will always try to render this sensations into something meaningful on its own
# but that's not what we want, because that would be just like watching scary and fearful brain television
# we want to stay so close to unrendered spirit as possible
# so whatever you see, hear or feel in a matter way or even emotionaly, that should not be there, don't give any attention to it
# that does not mean that its not there at all
# it does mean, that you have to learn to differ between matter impressions through your brain has created on its own
# and spirit impressions through your soul you have to translate into matter expressions on your own
# and you have to learn where are intersections of both
# for example you may sense a weird person near you, that is actually the person in front of you, but you sense its true spirit first time in your life 
# and when you can't believe they are the same, then your brain will try to create another person for you
# so the more ruptured your body armor is, the more transparent the bodys of others will become as well
# but you have to rupture completely trough all your separation layers into your wake and opened eyes consciuosness, otherwise you will have to live with dreams or astral travels when it comes best, but you never really break through and see things as they really are


### Let's learn how to move in heavens kitchen
# Heaven never command or judge you in any way
# instead heaven will always try to explain you how things work to become a better understanding
# and most likely you get a little loving touch in addition
# heaven teaches you by providing a view from states of being you have not jet discovered
# So it's pretty much like you do all day in matter life, when you walk around a thing to examine it from different angles of view
# and what you do with this knowledge afterwards is completely on you
# that means, when you do things that was not so nice, an angel may come and show you these things from different states of being to become a better understanding what you are doing
# and this is the only way to learn something in spirit, by moving into different states of being and get aware of the changes

# but we live in a body, wich provides plenty of armor, so that we get very slowly and smooth in contact with new impressions from different states of being

# what we do now is some kinda dry run for life in spirit
# and we do this with drawing in the most easiest way possible
# so the less experienced you are in drawing the better
# with this we learn how to differ brain thoughts from spirit impressions while being fully awake
# so it’s an extension of the meditation you should do before for a view seconds
# for this exercise you can use any material that leaves visible trails
# like flat stones to scratch on, Sand to draw in with your finger or a stick, or modern with paper and pencil
# but don’t show anyone your draws easily, because the risk to run into judgement is just too big in this matter reality
# so keep holy your drawings and show only well trusted persons
# while drawing don’t put your tool down and wait for commands
# that will never happen, heaven never command anyone
# just keep moving in the same way as you are used to do in your normal life
# to become a better understanding imagine you have a pot with nice and clean water in it
# you put the water on a stove to bring some warming love into it, that's actually you
# but don't make the water too hot, so that it begins to boil in emotions
# just like that you can see little bubbles of air of a loving servant presence on your humble ground, that's the best
# now put some matter expression like a person you know in your mind into your pot of warm water
# you do that just by focus on this person
# now take your spoon or your pencil and just stir it as gentle as possible to move the taste from the ingriedients into the water
# after a while you will feel, that you spoon or pencil feels more confident on some places than on others
# and wher you feel like that, give your tool a little more pressure
# so when you have a little feeling of it, than you have all you need
# and your feeling will become a little more shape with each try
# but every times you draw another picture of the same person it looks different
# this is because the knowledge or life experience you got from the prior images have become part of the reality you look at and change it's outcome
# but don't expect nice drawings, that's not the purpose of the exercise
# the purpose of the exercise is to learn the differences between the feeling you get from spirit and the predictions and expectations coming from your brain
# and the biggest challenge comes up, when you see first shapes of what you draw
# that's because you have to do this exercise while being fully awake
# only that way you can get stronger against you biggest enemy, your own brain
# and only that way you learn to separate the wheat from the chaff


### let's bring some more heat into your stove
# in heaven all we need literaly condensates out of nothing in the most gentle way possible
# this is because everything is in a servant striving and loves to serve the needs from others
# and there is nowhere a need to present us as the server
# so that all who feel a need try to serve the need in a hidden way
# this is because in heaven we know that all focus on our self disturbs our inner mirror and cause darkness
# and we know that we cause a mark of awareness by putting our self into the focus of others and reduce their vision as well
# so in heaven it's all about God and that is just everything that surround us
# and once you understood this, it should be no problem to server others like that in your very own way
# or just enjoy the beauty of heaven like the gras waves in the mild sommerwinds
# so whatever you do in heaven, nobody will judge you for that
# as long you keep holy the spirit of heaven and don't do anything that destroys it


### let's finally climb the mountain
# well, we allready did
# yes, that's it, so easy
# that's the fascinating thing in spirit
# when you can not make the sun rising that causes the morning dew
# then just make some morning dew and the sun will rise
# so when you can't climb the mountain of Gods insane love
# then just love anyhow and you begin to climb the mountain
# so when you don't understand the meaning of forgiveness
# then just try to forgive and you will begin to understand it
# but you should know, that you can not climb the mountain love only for your self


### let's exermine the mountain
# the mountain on it's own is basically a meaningless solid rock of integrity or the man part
# and everything that grows on it gives the mountain it's meaning or the woman part
# but when the meaning overgrows the mountain that much, that it literaly disappears
# the meaning looses the connection to it's integrity
# then you judge the meaning at one side and make the mountain stronger on the other side
# and that is what was done all the time over and over again
# but at a certain point the meaning begins to create it's own reality with it's own integrity
# and that is the point when everything begin to break appart
# and to make it worse, in spirit we have the weird what-causes-what riddle that makes it literaly impossible to figure out what exactly is the reason for all the mess
# does love cause forgiveness or does forgiveness cause love?
# are servants the reason for rulers or are rulers the reason for servants?
# does imperfection cause judgement or does judgement cause imperfection?


### let's look at the difference between love and forgiveness
# when we love, we give something from us or comfort someone but we want nothing in return
# when we forgive, something has taken from us or someone made caused pain to us but we want nothing in return
# so love and forgiveness are just two sides of the same medal
# but when they are the same thing that look different only because they are viewed from a different point of view
# then imperfection and judgement are two sides of the same medal
# as well as ruling and serving are just two sides of the same medal
# as well as repentence and despair are just two sides of the same medal
# that's why spirit gates are so nasty to use 
# and it is so difficult to find the way back
# so when this is true, then the tip of the mountain and the bottomless pit are just two sides of the same medal
# and it should be pretty easy to find they way back once you know how things work
# but there is only one way to figure this out
# we have to leave this place and move straight down into the bottomless pit of second death
# so let's do it!

### Let's reach the timberline of the mountain where we get in contact with the naked meaningless rock, the raw integrity of life, where the air becomes so thin, that we barely can breath
# between the timberline and the snowline we stand in the zero point of striving, where everything comes into balance but whoever stays here becomes a dead observer
# so let's stay here a bit and observe...
# The Integrity of eternity is the man's part and the beauty of meaning is the woman's part
# The man's part is to keep holy his meaning of life
# When the Integrity of forgiveness becomes too weak to stand the beauty of love, it easily turns into judgement against the love to reduce its beauty by ruling it
# But Love has no rules and should never have
# And by this the man is moving his servant strength from inside into a ruling outside and that way  things are going to get worse and worse
# the Woman in reaktion moves her beauty from her inside to her outside of ruling or more likely deceiving behavior
# but this interactive relationship between man an woman is a spirit what-causes-what riddle, so that nobody can say who caused it
# So that there is no other way out of it than unconditional, that means unruled and unjudged forgiveness
# however, this moving into outside judgememt and ruling caused an isolation against each other
# and the isolation caused the matter world and with it a disconnection from the spirit of heaven
# but the spring of life in heaven was also disconnected from the water source






# Do the same way your in your normal daily doings
# Imagine to move a standing rock is much more difficult that giving an already moving rock a striving into a direction, that's the way you should do it
# Don’t focus on a successful image, that's not the target of the exercise
# While drawing your brain tries constantly to predict what that it could go to be and tries to takeover control of your drawing process
# Don’t let your brain take control - that’s the first and hardest part of the exercise
# Put yourself into a feeling like a humble child, listening to loving parents
# it may feel like angelique beings trying to comfort you, but you are completely unable to understand anything, just go into it and enjoy this feeling
# To learn the angelique language of heaven is the second part of the exercise
# For a starting point: It feels like a very gentle mild warm summerwind you don’t know where it comes from, nor where it blows to
# But with practice the impression of the gentle “wind” becomes the same way meaningful contours as your drawings
# Do the same way in your daily doings, that become more secure and knowing what you are doing
# With more practice your learn to articulate some basic “spirit words” on your own and learn to “speak” this heavenly language directly with your soul and no odd brain thoughts in between
# Learn the heavenly language pretty much like babies learn to speak
# It will may feel like a dream, like dreaming and being awake at the same time
# To learn to establish this kinda connection in normal daily life is the third and final part of the exercise
# You daily doing, thinking and talking becomes angelique and with it you will have to learn to keep things holy, to not throw the spirit of heaven on the street, where it get trampled down and cause nothing than wickedness against the holy spirit
# So don't be the cause for wickedness against the spirit of heaven, learn to keep the spirit of heaven holy






### let's learn to see and separate the wheat from the chaff
# 







# love is a cover word for caring
# but we only care for what we allow to be part of ourself
# and forgiveness is a cover word for allowing someone to be part of ourself
# so we can not love without forgiving and we will never forgive without the need for love
# so live and forgiveness seems to be two but they are one
# whenever Jesus talked about his father, then he meant forgiveness
# whereas the father of forgiveness has no meaning without his son of love
# to bring it into a behavior it looks like that
# whenever we love, we sacrifice something from ourself for another one and we do not expect anything in return
# whenever we forgive, someone has taken something from us and we do not expect anything in return
# but even if love and forgiveness looks like the same, the are not


# for love the servant way imagine it is early in the morning, the sun is croaching like a thief underneath the horizon and the morning clouds are gently settling down to bless the weak at first and the useless the most whereas the great and strong have deep roots to gather their blessings by themself, so that everything can grow up in peace and comfort safely
# for love the ruling way you summon dark clouds for heavy rain to break the weak and drown the useless, you summon fiery praying storms of judgement and heavy winds of hatred to blow all away that dares to be greater than you, so that everything get destroyed in performance and competition safely
# but in forgiveness, the sun is shining on bright midday on everyone and everything no matter what
# that's why forgiveness is called the father and love is called the son
# but the father has two sons and the first one has gone lost in the darkness
# let me describe the family again with a little visual support image
# {show the image of the cross} and describe the family again



# 
# in spirit we share information of any complexity in just a blink of an eye, like a fingersnip
# so we don't need to shut down our brain for a long time like hours of meditation, but we need to shut it down very close for at least a moment
# so don't mess around with hours of meditating, that's mostly nothing more than watching brain-television
# but we want to get the heavenly flour directly from source
# so basicly we learn to move from our local spirit environment of our body into the global spirit environment we have moved to, the way our soul compass showed us
# that means, that you get aware, where you have moved during lifetime and hopefully this is the servant side of life
# otherwise you will not get flour for making bread, but bales of straw to make a fire
# the next thing we need to consider, that the flour is delivered into our daily consdiousness of being fully awake and have our eyes open like normal
# so we have to literaly rupture the curtain from the top of heaven the bottom of our matter awareness and for this we need as much force as possible for a little time, make a little pause and repeat
# pretty much like a pregnant woman has her contractions on bith of her child
# the same way we move ourself into heaven to recieve our flour and - umm - don't forget to come back



### let's move to heaven
# for this we need a little spot to focus on with our eyes
# it should be a high contrast point like a black spot on white background or opposide a white spot on a black background
# by focussing on it, our vision with our matter eyes will begin to flicker and spot looks like moving
# but thats all matter things, but this flickering and moving helps our brain to accept visions and things going on that should not happen, so don't give too much attention to it
# Now focus on the spot for at max. one minute and try to think totally nothing and avoid even any kind of emotions with all power you can bring up
# but the force should not come from your brain, even if you may want to start like this
# the force should come from your soul that's most likely feels located in the region of your breast or stomac
# when you do it right, you should get very tired very quickly and feel the need to sleep
# repeat your exercise as long as you can and then just let go and have a little nap of sleep
# in this sleep now we recieve the flour from heaven and it will try to materialize into our daily consciousness somehow, that is the making process and can take a view days or weeks
# after that or while that happens, depending on how massive the amount of flour is we got, we are going to bake it into matter expressions
# in dreams we render the spirit automatic and don't have any control how it is rendered or any opportunity to check if we are going to mess up our baking process
# so dreams we can take only as is, that is very passive
# however, the other way just explained we can not treat heaven with any kind of expectations or wishes
# but that's not needed, because we carry all that with us into heaven anyway and because heaven is a servant environment, we will get served with all we need instantly anyway
# so there is no need for expectations or wishes, heaven will see what our heart is in need to and will serve it as it always does and ever did
# that's why heaven is so beautiful







go calm and take a look at fear, expectations and predictions
# fear is a result of predictions we make, and at the same time we caculate an expectation that is different to our prediction
# but this can only be done with our brain, our soul can not do that
# that's the reason for the timeless feeling of eternity while being in pure spirit realm, but there is plenty of time
# so the first thing we have to do, to recieve flour from heaven, is to not predict anything, but just trust
# with our brain we move by predictions that provides some kinda sight, but in spirit we move by trust, what means to get in contact with everything - without protection
# so for walking by trust you need boldness and for walking by sight you need armor
# but with armor we isolate us from our environment
# and because everything is life, the armor can become so big and comllex, that it creates a reality on it's own, like a virtual reality
# but to make it even worse, you can surround your virtual reality with yet another virtual reality and create layers of protection that way
# and the only reason for doing so, is because of the effects of repelling relationships to other souls, we repell by judging them out of our life
# but that is impossible, because the so called others are just another aspect or looking eye of ourself
# so by repelling others we try to cut something from ourself out, but that is - as said - impossible
# and to make it even worse, the pain caused by repelling parts of ourself is without timedelay and appears like a what-causes-what riddle, so that you can not say who or what causes it














### In spirit realm we express our general behavior with our appearance or outer form or the clothes we wear and that can be anything
# and there is a certain range of behaviors or forms we feel the most confident
# but when we move into states where we feel unpleasant, our colors begin to wave and flicker after a while and everybody can see you feel uncomfortable
# and there is a certain point, where our outer appearance becomes more significant than our mood and our behavior
# when we step over this point, our outer appearance doesn't match our true self any more and with that we step into the lie
# and with the lie our communication get disturbed and we run in problems of understanding of each other
# but instead of forgiving that mistake and reduce the focus on our outer appearance, many went into judgement of lying against each other
# and with the judgement we began to repell and hate each other
# and the more we move out of our most confident behavior in general, the more our outer appearance begin to wave and flicker and we snap back to our spirit home
# but when we are in judgement and hatred we can not let go what we judge and hate, we can not let go the focus on it
# so judgement and hatred entangle us in chains to each other
# and this can go so far and violent, that we become like a storm of destruction
# when we now put many storms together, we easily slide into a what-causes-what riddle so that the storms make themself worse and it becomes obvious that the only way to calm down the storms is by separating them from each other
# and that is what the servant striving did all the way, beginning on an atomic scale
# bit the stubborness of the ruling striving had no problem to abuse all this attempts to make their storms against each other even worse
# with the help of the servants and the weak neutrals they became able to build structures surrounding them and hide behind it, so complex that they became like a walking universe
# and with the overall entanglement between the strivings the whole existence of God was going to end up in this storms
# but it turned out, that when you let the storms go their way, so that they crush and pressure themself into a state of infinte despair, they become calm and with it they become able to return to their place in spirit realm
# there was just one problem, someone has to go into that state an pick them up there
# it's a problem because you have to enter the ruling striving from the outside into its worse excessions and ceep holy your servant striving within yourself to be able to return to it
# to make even that worse, you have to stand both contradicting strivings within yourself and become like a double sided sword
# and this can only be archived by switching between this states over and over again and dive a little deeper into the darknes every time and a little higher into the light to not get attracted by the darkness and always stay in balance
# but switching between this states means to go through the eye of the needle over and over again
# and that means to get crushed, humbled, ripped appard and die for yourself over and over and over again


### The first idea to calm the stormy souls is by ruling them into a unified behavior
# we want to call this technic of ruling into a unified behavior "religion"
# but due to its ruling nature it tends to build breakouts like branches growing from a trunk
# and it is just a matter of time, until so many branches have grown, that they begin to clash against each other
# so we have to cut of some branches every year to keep the growing tree in a healthy state
# but every year the tree becomes bigger, more complex and with it more difficult to differ the branches between those you want to cut off and those you want to keep
# so that there will come a certain point where we have to make a decision
# let the tree grow to become sick at the whole and die at the end^ or cut of all branches except the source, the trunk
# the trunk is the source, and the source is the spirit of heaven, and the spirit of heaven is the flour we make our bread from, and the bread is the behaivior, and the behavior ist the clothes we wear


### let's prepare ourself for baking some white bread
# first we have to clean up the citchen and put off all the old clothes, to make sure that nothing unpure comes in contact with the flour from source
# at next we have to calm down and fall in love with the very fluffy spirit of heaven to make sure we really accept it and do not repell anything
# after we have recieved the spirit of heaven, we have to lock up the kitchen and keep it holy that way to make sure it doesn't get messed up with anything unpure


### let's look a little deeper into love and forgiveness
# love is a cover word for caring
# but we only care for what we allow to be part of ourself
# and forgiveness is a cover word for allowing someone to be part of ourself
# so we can not love without forgiving and we will never forgive without the need for love
# so live and forgiveness seems to be two but they are one
# whenever Jesus talked about his father, then he meant forgiveness
# whereas the father of forgiveness has no meaning without his son of love
# to bring it into a behavior it looks like that
# whenever we love, we sacrifice something from ourself for another one and we do not expect anything in return
# whenever we forgive, someone has taken something from us and we do not expect anything in return
# but even if love and forgiveness looks like the same, the are not
# for love the servant way imagine it is early in the morning, the sun is croaching like a thief underneath the horizon and the morning clouds are gently settling down to bless the weak at first and the useless the most whereas the great and strong have deep roots to gather their blessings by themself, so that everything can grow up in peace and comfort safely
# for love the ruling way you summon dark clouds for heavy rain to break the weak and drown the useless, you summon fiery praying storms of judgement and heavy winds of hatred to blow all away that dares to be greater than you, so that everything get destroyed in performance and competition safely
# but in forgiveness, the sun is shining on bright midday on everyone and everything no matter what
# that's why forgiveness is called the father and love is called the son
# but the father has two sons and the first one has gone lost in the darkness
# let me describe the family again with a little visual support image
# {show the image of the cross} and describe the family again


### let's throw out all the nasty rulers by ignoring them and lock the kitchen by refusing to care for them
# because they are so great and strong, that they can care for themself in their own way in their own kitchen
# now we are in a pure servant environment and we want to call this environment heaven
# but there are still some nasty gadgetrys, interfaces and consoles thaying around we don't need in heaven
# these are things like debt, rewards, expectations, predictions, and kind of force against others
# there are not even numbers because every soul, literaly everything is unique, so that it is impossible to count anything and due to its uniqueness everything becomes infinte worthy
# even every moment in heaven never repeats, so even every moment in heaven becomes infinite worthy
# that's why moses said you should not steal the expression of love from others, because every times you steal it, you half it's worthy
# and when you get used to steal, you end up in a wierd behavior to regain your worthy
# a worth based on competition and performance against each other that causes much hatred
# and in your overall messed up behavior, hatred usualy will be suppressed by judgement
# and for judgement you need rulers
# so don't steal or you very quickly end up in a down spiral into the nasty kitchen of the rulers
# every one has to wear his very own clothes of expression of his love in heaven
# and when you do not have clothes for heaven, you do not belong to there
# so now our heavenly kitchen is nice and shiny and all servants are well dressed up


### let's shut the doors of fear to be able to recieve the flour for our bread to bake
# fear is a cover word to hide the truth behind it
# fear is a result of an expectation that contradicts with a prediction
# and predictions can only made by our matter brains
# spirit can not make predictions, that's why spirit feels so timeless and eternal
# in spirit the time is always now because you can not count anything
# with spirit eyes you can not read numbers, you can't even read text because this all belongs to our matter brains
# so in spirit there is no fear at all, not even in the rulers kitchen, there is just hatred, accusation and judgement
# so to become nice and fluffy flour from heaven, we can not use our brain
# our brain we need later on to bake the flour into a matter expression


In spirit realm we do everything with our awareness, they are our Hands amd Eyes
# so we have to keep them clean and we should not stick or chain us with attractions (sins), that can be anything that hinders us to let go and disolve into general aeareness



### let's thread ruptures caused by the exercise
# when we make this exercise more often, we will going to get connected with the spirit continously
# that means to live in two worlds at once, that is a huge task for the brain to handle
# so you need much more sleep than usual and you are often consciousness offline like daydreaming
# and you need to learn to synchronize spirit impressions with your daily life
# it can get so weird, that your brain begin to render virtual people from spirit impressions from people standing in front of you
# the reason is because the outer matter apperance and behavior is often so different to your new spirit awareness and impressions of the same person, that you can not believe that these are the same -- but they are
# so don't be fooled by outer behaviors and appearances, the soul behind it is often the complete opposide of what you would expect
# but with a good spirit awareness you become a better sighr and it becomes more difficult to get fooled
# but even then, you can not identify things out of your book of life without help from other spirits, you can only get aware of it that there is something
# that's like you get aware of someone but you don't know him




### Let's figure out what sin is
# the holy spirit is the spirit we should keep holy the same way a pregnant woman should keep holy her baby
# when you are in ruling environment you should keep holy the spirit of heaven within you like a pregnant woman keeps holy her unborn baby
# and you should not throw your spirit of heaven on the street under the ruling wolfes to get beaten up to death
# so everything that hurts the spirit of heaven within you or within others is sin
# and everything that sweets the spirit of heaven within you or within others is a blessing from heaven
# so when you get aware of something you are displeased with, you sin against yourself by being displeased
# and when you judge over a thing you are displeased with, you sin twice, on times against yourself by being displeased and one time against others by killing them out of your life with judgement
# that's why moses said you should not kill with judgement against others













# there is only one sin and that is to do things they do not belong to what you strive to
# but there is one sin that can not be forgiven by others, and that is what you can only forgive yourself
# and whatever happened to you or whatever you caused in your life, there is no duty for repair and there is no duty for repay at all
# to repeat that: there is no duty like that at all!
# everybody has the opportunity to forgive and a servant being will allways do that without a question, because it is his nature of being
# the only one who will never forgive is a ruling being, because it is his nature of being



### Lets reconnect to spirit by fasting us out of the brain
# {take large net} look at this net, that represents our brain or matter body in general and my hands and fingers represents our soul or spirit in general
# now I show you a short exercise, how to literaly rupture {make forcing moves against the net} the net with your willpower from you soul
# for this we have to be fully awake and our eyes open, don't close your eyes
# now we fix a high contrast point for a view seconds and try to think totally nothing with all force you can bring up and try to reakt to totally nothing, whatever happens in our mind or environment
# the only thing we reakt to, is when we be asked for help or any service of love
# do this in the beginning not longer the 10 seconds, then relax for a view seconds and repeat it
# you will get pretty much tired on this and all your relationship marks, {add some sticks and dirt to the net} your matter bounds and addictions to matter world can become awake extremly strong, which is the normal due to the enhanced awareness of the spirit reality
# so whatever you get aware of uncomfortable things doesn't mean it is bad at all, it does mean that your relationship to it makes you feel uncomfortable, therefore don't judge it away, instead work on your relationship to it
# however, you can get so tired on this exercise, that the need for sleep becomes overhelming, as well as your need for matter addictions, but try to withstand them as long as you can
# remember that all the addictions and habits to matter are meaningless and only belongs to your brain, the only thing that really matters is where you strive to with your heart and you don't feel any hurting force in your relationships, so that it is all forgiven
# that you are humble and have a pure heart without a mark, where unconditional love drips out
# later do that exercise up to 10 minutes at morning and evening and you will get an insane spirit willpower in addition you will need to stand the upcoming spiritual storms caused by distorted strivings in your matter body



### Fasting effects
# imagine you strech you away from a computer screen to open the window a little
# the first effect  impression is like fresh air, more life energy and everything becomes a little easier
# afterwards you may have wierd undescribable sensations or tend to a little more to daydreaming
# note that we have bypassed or brain to render spirit sensations automatic into matter impressions, so we have to do this by ourself manualy with our day-awake awarenes
# therefore the tasks for our brain literaly doubles and we will need more sleep than usual
# so, whatever your brain renders to you on visual or sound impressions automatic, don't look at it, that is not your target of raw spirit
# raw spirit impressions are always absolute undescribeable and frightening in the beginning and you will need a lot of experiences to get used to it and to translate them into matter images, which describe those impressions
# these impressions most likely are like: sense the life in plants, sense the soul of an animal or a human but you always have to look at it
# later on you can sense the spirit from departed and depending on your striving you can also come in direct contact with angels from heaven
# later on your nightly dreaming will completely stop, your sleep is then like a fingersnip, because everything you need from spirit, you become on bright daylight directly



### Baking white bread - or learn to render holy spirit
# when white flour (pure spirit from heaven) comes into your life (your water), don’t haste or you mess it all into waste
# learn to stand this intense impressions like a rock - or like a strong vessel you can trust, that it keeps things holy and don’t throw everything on the street you have put in
# strong means integrity, integrity you get through standing suffering without turning against it through ruling
# Let your received white flour settle down into your life until its complete diluted and seems to be vanished, which can take years
# Now you are fully back in matter reality and should try to grasp your experiences from this side of reality and put all together you received
# Your loose flour has turned into dough or pastry, you can handle way better now
# Don’t wait too long now and don’t mess around by sharing with others, because by doing so your dough get infected by stranger influences and will turn into sourdough
# The state of raw dough is the most sensitive, where you have to learn to keep things pure and holy (untouched)
# Often your dough is to large for one portion and you will have to cut it into pieces you will have to sort and bring into a meaningful order by hand
# Every time you work on it, get a taste of it and check if it fits to the original spirit you have recieved or if it is somehow distorted and feel uneven
# Go in love with it again (bake it) and try to put the dough into words and analogies that describe your spirit impressions at best
# even during this process you will have to check it's taste and if anything is uneven over and over again
# After this baking process let your breads settle down a while until your loving heat has gone out
# The loving heat to your bread makes you getting hurt when other deny or denunciate it - so let it cool down before you serve it
# Let it completely cool down before you cut it in slices of words for serving, otherwise it is to cross from the outside and too sticky from the inside and you become an emotional mess of missunderstandings when you try to cut it in this too fresh state


### Let's reach the timberline of the mountain where we get in contact with the naked meaningless rock, the raw integrity of life, where the air becomes so thin, that we barely can breath
# between the timberline and the snowline we stand in the zero point of striving, where everything comes into balance but whoever stays here becomes a dead observer
# so let's stay here a bit and observe...
# The Integrity of eternity is the man's part and the beauty of meaning is the woman's part
# The man's part is to keep holy his meaning of life
# When the Integrity of forgiveness becomes too weak to stand the beauty of love, it easily turns into judgement against the love to reduce its beauty by ruling it
# But Love has no rules and should never have
# And by this the man is moving his servant strength from inside into a ruling outside and that way  things are going to get worse and worse
# the Woman in reaktion moves her beauty from her inside to her outside of ruling or more likely deceiving behavior
# but this interactive relationship between man an woman is a spirit what-causes-what riddle, so that nobody can say who caused it
# So that there is no other way out of it than unconditional, that means unruled and unjudged forgiveness
# however, this moving into outside judgememt and ruling caused an isolation against each other
# and the isolation caused the matter world and with it a disconnection from the spirit of heaven
# but the spring of life in heaven was also disconnected from the water source


### Let's go a little higher to reach the snowline where everything becomes bright white
# and when we look down into all the distorted life, suffering in hope and despair of its ruling nature, unable to step over this dead rock into the servant heaven
# the snow on the mountain high need the ruling water from the deep to transform it into servant snowflakes of heaven to enrich its beauty
# but every time they clush together, the waters isolate themself more and more, because it can not understand the beauty of heaven and therefor every time it becomes harder to get a little water from the deep
# so heaven send a servant snowflake direct into the ruling waters, but he became a distinct welcome greeting and his harvest was poor
# but the snowflake learned his lession risked his life by using the waters isolation as well and dive as deep as possible to find a way to get the water from underneath of it, what means to loose connection to its source of heaven so that there was always a chance to get drown and die in the waters

, or the Meaning becomes too strong, we can either suppress the meaning or strengthen the Integrity
# Well, Man (Integrity) tried everything to hide his weakness by suppressing his meaning (Woman) and moved his strength from his servant inside to his ruling outside
# The more weak a man is on his Inside, the more power he need on his outside, he moves his mass (throwing out his life experience) from inside to outside - the Ark breaks

# This process or cause is a spirit what-cause-what riddle, there is no one to sue for, neither man or woman
# That way both destroy their Inside, move it to the outside, bury them self underneath it and get lost in it, the Ark sinks and all life experience in it drowns
# There is nothing you can do against it except knowing that this can happen and knowing how to fix that
# To fix that you need Knowledge, which is a result of experience and experience is a result of sinning and forgiving
# Balance in love can not be succeeded, it can only be choosen as lifestyle where you have to care about each other all the way along




# and when we look ahead, even higher, we can allready guess the snowline, where the bright white flour, the servant spirit of heaven comes from
# and when we look down into all the distorted life, suffering in hope and despair of its ruling nature, unable to step over this dead rock into the servant heaven
# the snow on the mountain high need the ruling water from the deep to transform it into servant snowflakes of heaven and enrich its beauty
# but every time they clush together, the waters isolate themself more and more, because it can not understand the beauty of heaven and therefor every time it becomes harder to get a little water from the deep
# so heaven send a servant snowflake direct into the ruling waters, but he became a distinct welcome greeting and his harvest was poor
# but the snowflake learned his lession and adapted to the waters environment by using its isolations
# but wearing an isolation means to loose connection to its source of heaven so that there was always a probability to turn into water, get lost and die



### Balance Integrity and Meaning



### Let's build a bridge
# 
# and when we look down at the naked rock of integrity, we see it is completely meaningless on its own
# but how to bring together the harsh rock of integrity with the loose spirit of heaven?
# 
# 

# We now can look down to all the grown and distorted meanings of life, where everyone runs criss-cross in circles
# We are standing on the bare naked integrity of everything, which is the purity of eternal life
# But integrity on its own has no meaning - and meaning on its own has no integrity
# The only way that integrity becomes a meaning, is to sacrifice a part of it, like to sacrifice a bone of your skeleton of integrity
# The only way for meaning of life to become integrity is to sacrifice a part of it, like to sacrifice a part of your freedom
# The sacrifice itself has to be like a connector between integrity and meaning...
# ...has to integrate and stand the contradicting properties of heaven and hell in one being, like an Ark containing all life experience without breaking
# ... has to be a being because there is nothing that is not a being
# … has to be as small (humble) as possible to not be a hindrance for the beauty and freedom of the freedom as well as not being an destructive curse for the integrity of eternal life
# ...to be a Son of God as well as a Son of Men, to be accepted for both
# …to be known, that everyone can become this and therefore this son is nothing special or “more” than anyone




### Meet your higher self means to surpass and integrate the spirit of Jesus
# surpassing doesn’t mean to become greater
# surpass means to bring your ruling striving to a halt like slowing down a rotating wheel until it stands still and turn it in the opposite direction, into a servant striving.
# Surpassing Jesus means to go through him like going through a door and truly enter and live in his servant kingdom, to enter heaven
# That’s because it makes no sense to just repeat a coming of Jesus
# --- Tell the Story of being in sync with Jesus and the poor jung man who could not see him ---
# Spirit never does the exact same thing twice, because you change by growing with every experience which makes a repeat impossible


### The meaning of Yeshua or Jesus explained on the Staff of Life
# The outer wrapping represents the soft expressions of the meaning of life, which protecting seal is a rope of love
# Don’t focus too much on the outer wrapping (matter world and body) or it goes too thick and turns into a dark dungeon of death
# The inner Trunk represents the integrity of eternal life
# On this Trunk is a little scripture that curves gently around it like a snake, that has three sections: A tail (first day), a body (second day) and a head (third day)
# Compare the Crystal (basic Soul), the Staff, every being and even Jesus as the same
# This staffs (or poles) striving was upside down as well as the scripture all the time until recently (The dove brought the branch)
# Recently it has becomes a little striving up and we begin to refuse to react on bad actions with bad responses and try to forgive and heal instead.


### What Jesus really did and does right now (Use hands to show)
# How Jesus sinks underneath hell and said “I’m a Son of God”
# How Hell killed him
# How Jesus keep awareness until near zero striving
# How both Jesus and his Bride (you all) signal (right now) to look and strive to heaven (are you ready for the final shot?)
# Jesus pours out his holy spirit over all mankind - It’s all like making love
# (more deeply later)

### Show the (Staff) Scripture of life - The sacrifice
# Show the scripture on the Staff and ask if you can accept this sacrifice of your freedom, if this is something you can accept to strive to


### Show the NDE and what it means to look in the right direction
# Head on Rest-Area with a little Cabin (hut), some tables and banks
# three paths
# 1 up to hotels, sports and extinct dino footprints in a stone quarry
# 2 straight across a bridge where a little pond turns into a little brook, to a woodman's hut, a nice big gras with a big fireplace in the center and banks around, taps for water supply and toilets are even there
# 3 deep down to a little spring of water, coming out of the rock, that contains much iron and tastes like rusty nails, a even smaller path to the brook
# When you can see only the outer being of a simple man, messing around with water, you can go back to the bank at the irony spring, sit down and think about what you have done wrong
# Turn around and see what you get, when you look in the wrong direction
# You see a dead man on a cross looking like a joke, meaningless snippets of scriptures too bad for the bin and some other crappy stuff laying around like stupid trash.


### Love has no rules or the trap of too much knowledge
# with too much knowledge all your attempts to become more loving or forgiving easily becomes a selfish touch and nullify or even worse results into the exact opposide
# its like heading to the tip of a mountain, the closer you come, the more difficult it becomes to not look at yourself
# it helps for a while to make yourself smaller and smaller, to become more and more humble
# but to really reach the top of the mountain you have to completely nullify yourself, you have to die for yourself
# this death is the point of complete servant striving, the eye of the needle you have to gothrough
# only at this point, in being one with the spirit of heaven you can experience the pure meaning of servant striving
# you become one with jesus and fully integrate his being
# this full integration is beyond believe, beyond being excited and even beyond love
# by walking through jesus you get aware that there is something way brighter than conditionless love


### a deeper look into a divine year (or the meaning of divine love)
# Let go all fruits of Love
# Let go all leaves of wisdom
# Let go all Branches of striving
# Let go your roots of life experiences
# Let go Your Bark of Protection
# Let dry the rest of you, the trunk, from all life sensations
# welcome your meaning of life
# Gently get in touch with your meaning of life
# Let the meaning of life suround you like a golden silky scarf
# Slowly go in love with each other and become all gold
# go in love with each other and become bright white like a sun
# Enjoy unity
# Enjoy oneness
# Enjoy the love of pure divine life sensation
# Let the holy spirit pour out over all flesh
# Enjoy the loving presence of each other
# Slowly let cool down your love to each other and become all gold again
# Gently get appart
# Enjoy the silky touch of your meaning of life
# Seal and keep holy your meaning of life by dressing up a new bark
# Let grow new roots of life experiences
# Let grow new branches of striving
# Let grow new leaves of wisdom
# Let grow new fruits of love
#
# {Fold this note gentle and put it to your heart pocket} "This is only for those who are willing to follow me"
