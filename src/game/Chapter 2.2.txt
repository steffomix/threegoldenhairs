Story:
blackness
what you see now is the timeless nothingness
--move mirror but straight
That discovered itself within itself
What you see now is a what-causes-what riddle of a timeless environment
And the seamless but also meaningless oneness of the first creation
But it wasn't as seamless as it looked in the first place
so when you look a bit closer, you see an impurity in the very center
And this impurity was the first ever asked question:
"who am I"
and with this question the war in heaven began
but in this stage this war was more like a need to express who you are
but to do so, you have to break yourself out of the oneness
-- turn mirror
to become a different point of view of reality
And with a different point of view you discover diversity
So in a timeless environment creating and discovering is the same
And by stepping out of the oneness you become an impurity of your former oneness
and with it you stepp into a different state of being and simply disappear out of sight of your former oneness
Because the former oneness has not yet discovered your new statevof being
so you have to find back to your former state of being in the oneness
and melt together with it again like a drop of water falling into an ocean
and pollute your experience of a new state of being with the oneness
so that the former oneness can move in and out of your discovered states of being as well
And all of the former oneness become like you
So let's call them of the former oneness "drops of the water of the ocean of the oneness"
Or just angels
So whoever manage to discover new states of being and manage to return to the oneness becomes the blueprint of all angels or just the morning star

so lets move into a different point of view
-- take inverse single tree and hide bottom and reveal from top to bottom
There are main strivings
The striving for oneness and the striving for separation
In the striving for oneness we experience the meaning of life
And by striving for separation we try to express our understanding of the meaning of life
And by expressing our meaning of life we become a more diverse understanding of life
-- move pattern down
But the more you move into the diversity of the expressions of life, the less significant becomes the meaning of life
and there is a certain point, where the expression becomes more significant than the meaning
And when you step over this point, the meaning gets literaly buried underneath the expression
-- play chapter 1 snippet "like a seed in the earth"
And the result is what we percive as matter reality
-- move pattern over the tipping point
And with it we step jet another times into a complete different point of view
So examine both realities, strivings or points of view


In this above reality, let's call it the servant striving, the sensation of oneness is stronger than the sensation of the separation, so that the matter expression plays an optional or secondary role
-- take hands to describe
just imagine my left hand is the spirit state of being (or spirit meaning) and the right hand behind it is just an optional matter expression of it, to give you an unique appearance and the opportunity to seperate yourself out of the oneness
And with it it you become an impression of who you are relative to others who you are not

However, due to the nature of the loose matter in the servant striving, the distance between two shards (or souls) of the oneness is based on their current state of being
So the oneness itself is basically a state of being of infinite forgiveness
And whatever you do to others in the oneness will be instantly reflected as if you do it to yourself - which causes the what-causes-what riddle
However, the reflective effects can't be avoided at all, they can only be delayed through separation
And this delay of the reflective effects of the oneness is what we percive as time

So forgiveness always bring us back into the oneness
And it is love that let us reach out for the unknown and causes all the trouble coming with it

But what does that mean?
To come together in the servant striving you have to accept the others state of being as being part of your self. 
-- use hands fingers to come together
And when you come together, you literally melt into each other like two different colorized drops of water. And of course, the more seam the colors are, the more pleasant is this coming together, but also the more meaningless and - let's name it - more boring. 
And the more the colors differ, the more unpleasant is it to get in touch with it

So in the servant striving the definition of prosperity and freedom of movement is based on the diversity of states of beings you allow to be part within your self.

That's because love is reaching out for new adventures and is therefore the troublemaker itself
It is love who always causes trouble and challenges the forgiveness to accept it.


-- move to other side
So let's look into the other side and call it the ruling striving. 
When the meaning gets buried underneath its own expression, the perception of reality completely changes. So basically everything switches upside down.
The experience of separation becomes that strong, that it becomes impossible to get in direct spirit touch like melting into each other.
-- use fists instead of fingers to come together
So the only way to get a sensation of prosperity, is by surrounding your self with others who are willing to underthrow themself your rules.
And because everything is moving that way, everything tries to literally eat each others prosperity, to become an even greater ruler than others, to not get eaten up. 
And due to the great distance throug the separation to each other, the ability to communicate with each other is very distorted and full of missunderstandings.

So, in short, the ruling striving is just like this:
-- play ruling movie

So when you not manage to become a great ruler in the ruling striving, you literally sink down like disgusting fish poop in the ocean.
And you are going to experience your very own nothingness in a state of being of infinite despair and hopelessness.
-- play constantine in hell
And there is no way out, except you have managed to keep the spirit of the servant striving of the oneness or just heaven deep within yourself
But the memory of heaven burning in your heart, while being lost in the nothingness causes the worst spirit pain imaginable
And the only way to get rid of it, is to accept it, to forgive everything around you and - that is the hardest part - to forgive yourself.


And with it you discover a very new but jet very old point of view and state of being of the nothingness before all creation.
And you reconnect with the oneness as the father of yourself
Or you may want to call it: you become your higher self
But how this is in detail we see later

-- begin connect image 
however, with it you return to the beginning to share your experience with the oneness, that causes a huge impact
-- connect image and move fingers around
That rolls like a shockwave through all existence
To transform this, what looks like a seed
-- cut off tree
Into a living tree
and with it all angels of the oneness become alike
The old connection through matter life will get destroyed
and the strivings will get separated but be still connected through the new connection or door of infinite despair and hopelessness

but you don't have to go through all this
it is enougth when one is able to move through all this states of being without getting stuck 
So, for this I want to give you a little exercise, that helps you to break through mind into spirit realm
Imagine this like a hatchling breaks through its egg shell
To do so you need a high contrast point to look at, like this white dot for example
now stare at it for at least one minute but not longer than 10 minutes
And try to suppress all thougths, and sensations that will come up with all your willpower you can bring together
please note, that not the time counts you invest in this exercise, but your willpower
do this exercise once in the morning and once in the evening
After doing so, try to Relax for half an our and let your thoughts flow like daydreaming
you may also fall asleep And have a little nap if you want

However, due to the breakthrough into the spirit realm you may become sensations seemingly coming out of nowhere
they can be very weak, just like feeling a breath of fresh air
-- play spaceballs perry air
but become also very strong like a full qualified near death experience
-- play constantine

-- take picture of two trees
however, depending on how experienced you are in rendering spirit sensations through your brain
It will take some time, maybe even months to come to surface in your normal thougths
so be patient and keep in mind, that expectations are biggest hindrance, so try to stay calm and relaxed

but when they come to surface, they will be expressed according your believe systems, your diversity of knowledge and your creativity to describe things.
so when you know nothing but sticks and stones for example, you will have to express your experiences with sticks and stones

Therefore it is a good idea to develop a halfaway unified believe system, like a language to express spirit experiences

But for that we have to learn more about how to navigate in spirit realm

---- end chapter 2



-- take image of two trees
however, during this separation process you live in both strivings at the same time
that causes several iritating sensations that seem to come out of nowhere
that actually appears like a disfunction of your brain but is actually an extension into an ascended awareness











By breaking yourself out of the oneness you walk into new and therefore unknown expressions of who you are





what you see here is the spirit understanding of oneness
where every reflection is just another aspect of the same thing


mirrors
Create yourself into himself
The impurity is the first one, the observer
Two sides (strivings)
On which side is the impurity? (observer)
Who is the first, the most inner one

The what-causes-what riddle in the timeless oneness
Nothing is ever created but all is discovered
In timeless environment creation and discovering is the same

There is a need to express of who you are to discover yourself
This need is fullfilled in two major ways or sides: creating (impuring) and discovering (reflecting)
So even if the reflecting side of the nothingness is the first, from where everything is taken from, it is not the creating one

So there is one first one (that is truly the second) causes the light of awareness and causes all life that is all impure compared to the nothingness, but forgives the impurity and loves it anyway
And there is the second one (truly the first) reflects the light of awareness but has no life in it and judges and hates all creation as impure and never good (pure) enougth

So the first one (that is truly the second) is always under most pressure of experiencing the contrast of the hatred and judgement from the nothingness in his back and his love and forgiveness for his creation on before him

So there are two contradicting strivings or groups of creation and one first created or discovered from within the nothingness, who stands the contrast of all and nothing


God (nothingness) discover himself through all creation (expression)
Who was first, the nothingness of the entire beginning or the awareness of the nothingness?
The awareness within the nothingness is percived as an impurity from the nothingness
But the nothingness can not get aware of awareness, it can only reflect (simulate) awareness
Who is source of everything in existence, awareness or nothingness?

The awareness (the observer) is the source of impurity
The impurity of the observer multiplies in the deep of the reflections
Multiplied impurity causes darkness
The attempts to get rid of the impurity causes the war in heaven
The pure repel the unpure
But to repel impurity means to repel all existence
So the impurity is the expression of existence


To trees
Put the mirror effect on a plant and its roots
on top the awareness express itself downwards like looking deeper into the mirror
But at a certain point expression becomes more significant than it's source of awareness (inner spirit)
and the expression hides it's inner spirit 
and we become the matter point of view - the matter world - like in the roots
Where the entire point of view flips around
So that we become two major & contradicting lifestyles
The lifestyle of oneness and the lifestyle of separation

In the oneness we percive everything as being part of our self and care for it in a servant way
and the expression or appearance is an optional thing, only to describe our inner spirit or mood

In the separation we percieve everything as being foreign and care for it in a ruling way
and the inner meaning of an outer expression is an optional thing, only to describe the reason for the appearance

Show two hands flip lifestyles (strivings) - the more matter, the less meaning - vice versa

So there is no matter - it's all spirit - realities are based on point of view

sidenote: The picture is wrong - show invert tree and the war in spirit realm
the white top: the observer, awareness and source of impurity and all existence
The black bottom: the reflector, nothingness as the soil of all creation or discovery
so the observer, as the son of the nothingness looks into the nothingness, that is himself
Sounds strange but that is how it is

Return to two trees
But we human are special due to the deep separation level we live in, 
we can discover god within us and become a whole tree on its own
Whereas every stone, plant or animal is just a reflection within a tree with its limited free will

So, who put the soul of eternal life into our body? Nobody
We have to discover our soul in the same way the nothingness discovered itself
Otherwise we become like an egg that never developed life from within
The egg dies, become rotting, then forgetting, then sleeping, and finally dreaming a new opportunity of eternal life in a new egg

But even if it has come to life, it has to break through its egg shell.
And what is the shell for the egg, is the brain, or the matter reality in general for you.

So by caring for matter (the expression of spirit meaning) or focussing on using our brain we strengthen our egg shell
And by caring for spirit (the meaning of life) we develop the hatchling within the egg

Communicate in matter is like eggs clashing against each other


Break through

In the same way you can look through your matter reality, you can look into any others matter reality down to their soul


Break yourself out of the nothingness in a ruling way to experience the loneliness in your outruled separation and strive back into the oneness by accepting the former outruled to be part of your self

That is how the invert tree drift appart in wars
