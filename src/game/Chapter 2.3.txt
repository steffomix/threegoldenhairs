Story:
blackness
what you see now is the timeless nothingness
That discovered itself within itself
But discovering and creating is the same in a timeless environment
So the nothingness created awareness of itself
-- show light in center
And the awareness itself was light and light was and is awareness
But the light was also an impurity of the nothingness that is darkness and death
So that the darkness of the nothingness became an enemy of the light of awareness
-- move mirrors straight apart
And the awareness got aware of the nothingness
And the awareness got aware to be lost alone in the nothingness
-- turn mirror
And the awareness got aware of itself and stepped out of itself
And the awareness discovered another point of view of itself
-- show colorized star
But the nothingness also discovered yet another impurity of darkness and death
-- show bigger colorized star
And the awareness discovered the beauty of diversity within itself
But the nothingness dismissed the beauty of impurity of the awareness
-- show entanglement
So that there was a war between light and darkness



so lets move into a different point of view
-- take inverse single tree and hide bottom and reveal from top to bottom
There are two main point of views or you may want to call it strivings, stances, states of being, or just moods
Thart arr the striving of light or oneness and the striving of darkness or separation
In the striving for oneness we experience the meaning of life
And by striving for separation we try to express our understanding of the meaning of life
And by expressing our meaning of life we become a more diverse understanding of life
An understanding of what we are and what we can accept to be part of our self, that is usually called good, angelique or just heaven
And the the understanding of what we are not and what we can not accept to be part of our self, that is usually called bad, demonic or just hell
-- move pattern down
But the more we move into the diversity of the expressions of life, the less significant becomes the meaning of life
and there is a certain point, where the expression becomes more significant than the meaning
And when you step over this point, the meaning gets literaly buried underneath the expressions
-- play chapter 1 snippet "like a seed in the earth"
And the result is what we percive as matter reality
-- move pattern over the tipping point
where the meaning of life has become invisible and Is replaced by the expression of live
So that the expression of life becomes its meaning
And with it we step another times into a complete different point of view


In this above reality, let's call it the servant striving, the sensation of oneness is stronger than the sensation of separation, so that the matter expression plays an optional or secondary role
-- take hands to describe
just imagine my left hand is the state of being or (or spirit meaning) and the right hand behind it is just an optional matter expression of it, to give you an unique appearance and the opportunity to seperate yourself out of the oneness
And with it it you become an impression of who you are relative to others who you are not

However, due to the nature of the loose matter in the servant striving, the distance between two points of view (or lets call it souls) of the oneness is based on their current state of being
So in the oneness itself, or just heaven we are in a state of being of infinite forgiveness
And due to the absense of time in the meaning, eberything we do to others in the oneness of heaven will be instantly reflected as if we do it to our self - which causes a very confusing the what-causes-what riddle
However, the reflective effects of oneness can't be avoided at all, they can only be delayed through separation in the expression of the meaning of life
And this delay of the reflective effects of the oneness is what we percive as time

So the only way to bring as back into the heaven of oneness is through forgiveness
And it is love that let us reach out for the unknown expressions of life and causes all the trouble coming with it

But what does that mean?
To come together in the servant striving we have to accept the others and their state of being as being part of our self. 
-- use hands fingers to come together
And when we come together, we literally melt into each other like two different colorized drops of water. And of course, the more seam the colors are, the more pleasant is this coming together, but also the more meaningless and - let's name it - more boring. 

And the more the colors differ, the more unpleasant is it to get in touch with it, but also the more interesting.

So in the servant striving the definition of prosperity and freedom of movement is based on the diversity of states of beings we allow to be part within our self.

That's because love is reaching out for new adventures and is therefore the troublemaker itself
It is love who always causes trouble and challenges the forgiveness to accept it.


-- move to other side
So let's look into the other side and call it the ruling striving. 
When the meaning gets buried underneath its own expressions, the perception of reality completely changes. So basically everything switches upside down.
The experience of separation becomes that strong, that it becomes impossible to get in direct touch like melting into each other.
-- use fists instead of fingers to come together
So the only way to get a sensation of prosperity, is by surrounding our self with others who are willing to underthrow themself our rules.
And because everything is moving that way, everything tries to literally eat each others prosperity, to become an even greater ruler than others and prevent that way to not get eaten up.
So that this kind of separation creates an environment, that is percived as matter reality.
And this reality creates its own lifestyle of becoming the greatest, richest amd most powerfull.
Or just the kingdom of pride rulers, where performance and competition pave your way to discover all faces of hatred and judgememt.
A lifestyle where nothing is ever good enougth and where always the others are in charge for your suffering.
-- show jesus
An environment like sevage, where it doesn't matter how much pure water you pour into it, it not only stays sevage, it becomes even worse.
Because the diltuting of the sevage encourages to produce even more sevage.
And due to the great distance throug the separation to each other, the ability to communicate with each other is very distorted and full of missunderstandings.

So, in short, the ruling striving is just like this:
-- play ruling movie

So let's move into the point of view of the ruling striving
when you NOT manage to become a great and successful ruler in the ruling striving, you literally sink down like disgusting fish poop in the ocean.
And you are going to experience your very own nothingness in a state of being of infinite despair and hopelessness.
-- play constantine in hell
And there is no way out, except you have managed to keep the spirit of the servant striving of the oneness or just heaven deep within yourself
But the memory of heaven burning in your heart, while being lost in the nothingness causes the worst spirit pain imaginable
because from the point of view of the ruling striving you are someone who does not stand for the rules, but dare to forgive instead
You dare to give without expecting anything in return
You are a betrayer of the kingdom of pride
And the only way to get rid of this pain, is to accept it
to be not good enougth for the kingdom of pride
to accept to be lost in the nothingness
you are lost because yoz belong to the kindom of humble servants and therefore you are completely unable to find a ground to stand on in the kingdom of pride
and that means to forgive everything around you - and - that is the hardest part - to forgive yourself.
to admit, yes I am a looser
And do you know what? I'm happy with it

And with it you discover a very new but jet very old point of view and state of being of the awareness in the nothingness before all creation.
And you reconnect with the oneness
-- connect image

And with it you share your experiences with the oneness of heaven
-- move around connected image
And this experiences move like a shockwave through all states of being
-- cut of image
And at the end of this shockwave the old connection breaks appart
that results into a separation of the strivings
Because The old connection is not needed anymore
And with it the war of the strivings ends

-- Take image of two trees
And with the end of the war of the strivings we move into jet another point of view
In which you can move from the separation of the kingdom of pride into the oneness of the kingdom of humility with a little exercise

In this exercise you try to move into general awareness of oneness for just a view seconds or minutes at max
and at the same time you try to subpress all thoughts and ignore all sensations coming from the separation of matter reality
So this is a very contradicting state of being and very similar to moments you tap into, when you come into a life threatening situation.
So basically you try to cause a so called near death experience.

-- show high contrast dot image
To do so you focus on a high contrast point like this
you need this high contrast because your brain and eyes will make it go blurry while starring on it
And it may even completely vanish for some moments
And of course it helps you to prevent drifting away in your thoughts
-- show finger
But to be honest, even staring on your finger will do the job

However, the time you spend on this exercise is not what matters
what matters is how much effort of willpower you spend into this exercise

So when you make lukewarm exercises you basically will not get more out of them than just a little refreshing effects and perhaps some weak sensations coming out of nowhere
Just like this
-- play movie spaceballs 

Therefore you have to go really serious
just like that
-- play movie constantine until water drop moment

to break through the other striving
that will most likely feel like a short moment of a divine force, that pushes away all matter sensations with such an ease as if it is nothing
Just like that
-- continue movie constantine through break through

and what you have achived then is like a hatchling breaks through its egg shell
just like that
-- play chicken movie

-- show path through matter between trees
But due to the nature of separation in the matter reality, it takes some time until your brain has managed to process this new kind of sensations
however, you always have to deal with some time delay, no matter how good your processing abilities had become
And you always can render your sensations only with knowledge you have learned in the matter reality

But it will always be a little confusing 
just like that
-- play spaceballs instant video

So we need at least a little more knowledge about how to navigate in spirit realm
-- end video





But due the more diverse richness of states of beings you can acdept t be part of your self
The one oneness becomes part of your self instead of you become a part of the oneness
-- we see later how that is meant in detail
However, that way you rebirth yourself through yourself and become the father of your self
Or you may want to call it: you become your higher self



But how this is in detail we see later...

-- begin connect image 
however, with it you return to the beginning to share your experience with the oneness, 
and that causes a huge impact 

-- connect image and move fingers around
That rolls like a shockwave through all existence
because the awareness has accepted the nothingness to be part of itself

-- cut off tree
And with it the war in heaven ends
And we discover jet another point of view







Into a iving tree
and with it all angels of the oneness become alike
The old connection through matter life will get destroyed
and the strivings will get separated but be still connected through the new connection or door of infinite despair and hopelessness


therefore you don't have to go through all this
it is enougth when one is able to move through all this states of being without getting stuck 

All your thoughts are dreams 
Like a curtain that express you state of being
But also a hide that separates you from spirit reality 
And can become as dense as an egg shell of a hatchling
so you will have to manage to break through this egg shell
But you can't break through your egg shell with lukewarm actions
for this you need a life treatening exercic'se



So, for this I want to give you a little exercise, that helps you to break through mind into spirit realm
Imagine this like a hatchling breaks through its egg shell
To do so you need a high contrast point to look at, like this white dot for example
now stare at it for at least one minute but not longer than 10 minutes
And try to suppress all thougths, and sensations that will come up with all your willpower you can bring together
please note, that not the time counts you invest in this exercise, but your willpower
do this exercise once in the morning and once in the evening
After doing so, try to Relax for half an our and let your thoughts flow like daydreaming
you may also fall asleep And have a little nap if you want

However, due to the breakthrough into the spirit realm you may become sensations seemingly coming out of nowhere
they can be very weak, just like feeling a breath of fresh air
-- play spaceballs perry air
but become also very strong like a full qualified near death experience
-- play constantine

-- take picture of two trees
however, depending on how experienced you are in rendering spirit sensations through your brain
It will take some time, maybe even months to come to surface in your normal thougths
so be patient and keep in mind, that expectations are biggest hindrance, so try to stay calm and relaxed

but when they come to surface, they will be expressed according your believe systems, your diversity of knowledge and your creativity to describe things.
so when you know nothing but sticks and stones for example, you will have to express your experiences with sticks and stones

To give you an example:
The meaning is like a door like rose arch made out of stiff and dead wires.
And to give this meaning a life you have to plant a seed underneath to grow along the rose arch and express the meaning of life with it's beauty.
But when you forget the meaning of life underneath of all the beauty, the rose arch will collapses into a nice decorated pile of thorns, where everybody who tries to walk through will get stuck in endless pain of despair and hopelessness.
But to give this image a meaning, imagine the stiff and most likely ignorant appearing rose arch as forgiveness, the growing roses as the beauty of love and it's thorns as it's misstakes.
So what causes what? What causes the rose arch collapsing? Is the love of the roses too strong or is the forgiveness of the wires too weak?


End chapter 2 with:



Therefore it is a good idea to develop a halfaway unified believe system, like a language to express spirit experiences

But for that we have to learn more about how to navigate in spirit realm



---- end chapter 2



-- take image of two trees
however, during this separation process you live in both strivings at the same time
that causes several iritating sensations that seem to come out of nowhere
that actually appears like a disfunction of your brain but is actually an extension into an ascended awareness











By breaking yourself out of the oneness you walk into new and therefore unknown expressions of who you are





what you see here is the spirit understanding of oneness
where every reflection is just another aspect of the same thing


mirrors
Create yourself into himself
The impurity is the first one, the observer
Two sides (strivings)
On which side is the impurity? (observer)
Who is the first, the most inner one

The what-causes-what riddle in the timeless oneness
Nothing is ever created but all is discovered
In timeless environment creation and discovering is the same

There is a need to express of who you are to discover yourself
This need is fullfilled in two major ways or sides: creating (impuring) and discovering (reflecting)
So even if the reflecting side of the nothingness is the first, from where everything is taken from, it is not the creating one

So there is one first one (that is truly the second) causes the light of awareness and causes all life that is all impure compared to the nothingness, but forgives the impurity and loves it anyway
And there is the second one (truly the first) reflects the light of awareness but has no life in it and judges and hates all creation as impure and never good (pure) enougth

So the first one (that is truly the second) is always under most pressure of experiencing the contrast of the hatred and judgement from the nothingness in his back and his love and forgiveness for his creation on before him

So there are two contradicting strivings or groups of creation and one first created or discovered from within the nothingness, who stands the contrast of all and nothing


God (nothingness) discover himself through all creation (expression)
Who was first, the nothingness of the entire beginning or the awareness of the nothingness?
The awareness within the nothingness is percived as an impurity from the nothingness
But the nothingness can not get aware of awareness, it can only reflect (simulate) awareness
Who is source of everything in existence, awareness or nothingness?

The awareness (the observer) is the source of impurity
The impurity of the observer multiplies in the deep of the reflections
Multiplied impurity causes darkness
The attempts to get rid of the impurity causes the war in heaven
The pure repel the unpure
But to repel impurity means to repel all existence
So the impurity is the expression of existence


To trees
Put the mirror effect on a plant and its roots
on top the awareness express itself downwards like looking deeper into the mirror
But at a certain point expression becomes more significant than it's source of awareness (inner spirit)
and the expression hides it's inner spirit 
and we become the matter point of view - the matter world - like in the roots
Where the entire point of view flips around
So that we become two major & contradicting lifestyles
The lifestyle of oneness and the lifestyle of separation

In the oneness we percive everything as being part of our self and care for it in a servant way
and the expression or appearance is an optional thing, only to describe our inner spirit or mood

In the separation we percieve everything as being foreign and care for it in a ruling way
and the inner meaning of an outer expression is an optional thing, only to describe the reason for the appearance

Show two hands flip lifestyles (strivings) - the more matter, the less meaning - vice versa

So there is no matter - it's all spirit - realities are based on point of view

sidenote: The picture is wrong - show invert tree and the war in spirit realm
the white top: the observer, awareness and source of impurity and all existence
The black bottom: the reflector, nothingness as the soil of all creation or discovery
so the observer, as the son of the nothingness looks into the nothingness, that is himself
Sounds strange but that is how it is

Return to two trees
But we human are special due to the deep separation level we live in, 
we can discover god within us and become a whole tree on its own
Whereas every stone, plant or animal is just a reflection within a tree with its limited free will

So, who put the soul of eternal life into our body? Nobody
We have to discover our soul in the same way the nothingness discovered itself
Otherwise we become like an egg that never developed life from within
The egg dies, become rotting, then forgetting, then sleeping, and finally dreaming a new opportunity of eternal life in a new egg

But even if it has come to life, it has to break through its egg shell.
And what is the shell for the egg, is the brain, or the matter reality in general for you.

So by caring for matter (the expression of spirit meaning) or focussing on using our brain we strengthen our egg shell
And by caring for spirit (the meaning of life) we develop the hatchling within the egg

Communicate in matter is like eggs clashing against each other


Break through

In the same way you can look through your matter reality, you can look into any others matter reality down to their soul


Break yourself out of the nothingness in a ruling way to experience the loneliness in your outruled separation and strive back into the oneness by accepting the former outruled to be part of your self

That is how the invert tree drift appart in wars
